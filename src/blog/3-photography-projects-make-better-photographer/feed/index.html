					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/3-photography-projects-make-better-photographer/#comment-271297&quot;&gt;Steve Brodsky&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Steve,

This post, and blog in its entirety, isn&#039;t geared solely towards pro/seasoned photographers. So many of the tips you find here will be applicable to different levels of expertise. Kudos to you for lasting 11 months as taking on a 365 project is no easy feat. I know pro photographers who still complete 365 projects for various reasons. It helps them constantly practice being in a creative state. It might also be that they&#039;re working on specific techniques and shooting daily helps keep them accountable to practice. Or they might even just want to capture certain aspects (like their family) on a daily basis. Seeing it as &quot;making&quot; themselves do something is, in my opinion, the wrong perspective.They do it because they enjoy the exercise and because accomplishing a goal you&#039;ve set is an awesome feeling, no matter what the goal is. Thank you for chiming in!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alright. Long time lurker....finally had to sign up for an account and chime in.

Last year I picked up photography and embarked on a 365 project to learn the ropes. Being a rookie, I wasn&#039;t expecting Ansel Adams level results. A tapering of expectations along with a healthy dose of curiosity kept me well engaged for 11 out of 12 months. The twelfth month was a combo of crappy weather and heavy workload, but I digress...

Obviously, many of you on this site are established photographers. &quot;Making&quot; yourself take a picture every day for the sake of an end-goal seems a bit foolish. I do think the three-month project has its place, especially for the seasoned among you. For the rookies, however, I think a 365 project is relevant. Just remember, it isn&#039;t a 365 project. It&#039;s a &quot;one picture&quot; project, you just happen to be doing 365 times. :)

					<description><![CDATA[I have tried the 365 project but not been able to get along with it. I do like the look of the shoot like film project though. I have got a small x100s which I use as my walkabout camera. It&#039;s fixed 35mm lens means I have to think more about things which is great and makes me slow down.]]></description>
