					<description><![CDATA[I use the Sigma Art lens 35mm mostly on my Canon 5D mark iv and Sony A7iii , even though I have the 100mm, 70-200, 85mm
Absolutely love the 35mm in closed spaces. 
My husband captured shots of our son being born in a very small space in a clinic with the 35mm and I cannot be happier with this lens.]]></description>

I also have a crop sensor, I got a 35mm to give me a sort of nifty fifty. I love the sharpness and the bokeh you can get but I find it tight indoors so have just bought a wide angle zoom. Hoping it will be good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not have a FF camera and so I struggle to find the equivalent of the nifty-fifty. I do own a 50mm but with the 1.5 factor, it is a longer lens on my APC sensor. I haven&#039;t found a 35mm that gives me the same performance. Any ideas? I can&#039;t be the only person on clickinmoms without a FF canon or nikon!]]></description>

So glad that this inspired you to pick-up the fifty again! It&#039;s always nice to get reacquainted with gear that&#039;s been collecting dust ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a 35 and a 50 and I almost never use my fifty due to always feeling like I have to back away from my subject more than I would prefer. But this post has got me wanting to switch things up a bit and give it another go for a while!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do like my 50mm and it is probably the lens that comes out of my bag the most often. If I&#039;m stuck between 35mm or 85mm why use two lenses when the 50mm can do both. All you need to do is shuffle your feet a bit closer or further away.

A fixed lens also makes you think more about the photo. You do need to move. No quick zoom in or out and snap here.]]></description>
