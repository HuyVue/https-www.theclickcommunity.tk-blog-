					<description><![CDATA[I love this tip... &quot;Write your To-Print date on your calendar, the same day each month.&quot;  It sounds so simple, but what a great way to just remember to get this done.

I want to share that I just LOVE Project Life.  Becky Higgins (beckyhiggins.com) has a whole system with beautiful albums, gorgeous designed cards (both print and digital) and page protectors like the ones above.  The hardest part is deciding on a design.

Great tips!  Thanks for the motivation to print.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this post! I, like many photographers, am the worst hypocrite when it comes to printing images. I recognize the incredible value in having tangible proof of all the fabulous memories I have. I have started, for the first time ever, a yearbook and am now off to add a few more pages for printing :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I organize the same way and I heavily rely on the key words section in Lightroom. I occasionally put together a photo album based on favorite images or travel etc...but I have found photo books to be the best way to capture special times or years. For example I do a &quot;best of&quot; every year (it&#039;s actually Christmas presents for our moms, when my son played sports I did highlight books of seasons and I do a photography trip every year with a friend and we combine our best shots to document the trip. I recommend keeping your eyes on LivingSocial, Groupon and Amazon Deals. It can be a very inexpensive way to organize and share. Picaboo and MyPublisher have been the best to work with although I&#039;ve used many more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lacey,

As a scrapbooker first too, I hate to have my photos just in my computer. I struggle to go back and decide what to print. Thank you for sharing your process. I have always broken my folders down by date only and have such trouble finding photos .... even when I tag them - which seems like such a waste of time some days. 

You&#039;re the best!]]></description>
