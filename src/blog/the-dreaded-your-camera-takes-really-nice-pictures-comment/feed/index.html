the picture was taken it went to a file. So, what you need to do is 
first have some consultations with a few different counselors.
The young have no defenses that are capable of dealing with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved this article!  The experiment was a great idea.   I loved seeing how different the pictures looked.  I set up a shot once of my family and then asked a passerby to push the shutter button for me so I could jump into the picture.  The lady moved the angle of the camera from where I had it and the picture was completely different from how I had it (and I didn&#039;t like it at all!)]]></description>
