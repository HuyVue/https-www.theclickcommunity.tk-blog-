<p>Every year when it is time to go back to school, a little bit of melancholy sets in at our house. Another year has passed. My babies are a year older. (And so am I which is almost more cause for panic!)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But I want to celebrate the changes rather than mourning them. So I pick up my camera.</p>
<p>This year, as the kids head back to school, I encourage you to pick up your own camera. Let back-to-school be the event that allows you to see changes over the years. Allow it to be a reminder to capture who they are as they set out on a new year of growing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Use these ideas to document the start of the school year to hold onto a little bit of who they are now.</p>
<h2>Capture them in the out-of-school routine</h2>
<p>A large part of why the start of school can feel sad is that it is the end of those lazy summer days. There is something so magical about lazy days with no schedules or to-do lists. And yet, when there is “nothing happening,” we often forget to take our cameras out.</p>

			<p>So before you send everyone off to school, capture them in their summer state. Document the cartoon marathons and midday naps. Take a picture of bare feet in the back yard and cereal for dinner.</p>
<p>When you look back, these photos will probably matter more than most. It is so easy to forget how small they were and these simple little moments are the ones you can’t recreate.</p>
<h2>Capture the preparation for school</h2>
<p>Who here loved packing her backpack with fresh school supplies each fall?! I love capturing my kids as they get ready for a new year at school and there are so many creative ways to do it.</p>
<p>My kids always get new clothes for school and it’s so cute to watch them feel fresh and fancy as they head off to school. It also makes for the perfect photo opportunity as they are feeling their best!</p>
<p>Let your kids play model in their back to school clothes and take them out for a fashion photoshoot to show off their style. The kids will feel great and you will be able to document their age, stage, and style in your pictures.</p>
<p>School supplies are another photo-worthy subject. Books, papers, pens, backpacks, notebook paper, scissors, glue sticks…anything you can imagine! They are colorful, classic, and instantly connect with the viewer who will know that all of these things mean school time.</p>

			<p>I just love this shot by photographer Kate Luber. The flat lay on the dark table lets the colors of the supplies shine while those little hands at the bottom of the frame add a personal touch.</p>
<p>So don’t just send those supplies off to school with your kids! Let them be part of the story as you document the back-to-school memories.</p>
<h2>The backpack photo</h2>
<p>Of course, backpacks are school supplies like the items listed above. However, I feel as though backpacks deserve their own category when it comes to back-to-school photos. They are an opportunity for personal expression. They show a child’s growth as your little one grows into that big bag. And they are an instant signal that learning is ahead.</p>
<p>When my son was younger he had a ladybug backpack that he loved. As he got older, he wanted a Star Wars backpack. Now he has a huge backpack that almost does not fit on his back and it shows me how small he really still is.</p>

			<p>Every morning last fall, this was what I saw on my way to the car. My beautiful baby boy with his huge backpack and it always made me laugh. It is a memory worth keeping.</p>
<p>Let your child’s backpack not only tell the story of back-to-school. Let it show who they are and how they choose to navigate the world. And of course, capture it with your camera.</p>
<h2>Capture the school routine</h2>
<p>Do you have daily routines that happen every day before and school? Of course you do! Even if your routine is that you are routinely running around throwing at granola bars at kids and rushing them out the door before they miss the bus!</p>
<p>These are memories that are <i>definitely </i>worth capturing.</p>

			<p>My daughter is always so sleepy in the mornings and takes her sweet time getting up to have breakfast. While this can be somewhat stressful at times, its also part of our life. I know I will miss these days when they’re gone.</p>
<p>Think about the things that you might overlook when choosing photo-worthy moments. Those daily happenings that can feel insignificant until they are gone. Toothbrushing, breakfast preparing, hair braiding, shoe tying.</p>
<p>Kids grow and evolve and these routine moments grow and evolve with them. Take the time to document the routine to remember.</p>
<h2>Put it into words</h2>
<p>Another great way to remember every year is to use words. Whether it be a chalkboard, a letter board, or a simple piece of paper, write down the things that will help you remember this unique school year.</p>
<p>Consider including the date, your child’s name and age, the teacher’s name, the name of the school, and the grade level.</p>

<h2>The school bus</h2>
<p>We don’t have these beautiful schoolbuses where I live in Sweden. Still, nothing is a better symbol of school than a big yellow bus. People everywhere recognize this classic vehicle!</p>

			<p>Even better, that cheery yellow color is amazing for photography and really makes your images pop. So if your kid climbs in to one of these buses everyday, make sure to capture it!</p>
<p>Use the feelings you have for when school starts and turn them into something creative. Be inspired by a fresh start. And know that as you snap away, you are capturing precious memories of your family that will be cherished this school year and for years to come.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>life happens in midday sun. In fact, some of our favorite memories happen in these light conditions. And so rather than avoiding shooting at this time, I had to start finding ways to use it to my advantage. And you know what? I actually love to shoot in midday sun now! It’s fun! Here’s how you can fall in love with full sun photography, too.</p>

			<p>As a photographer, I love light. And not just “perfect” golden hour light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Instead, I try to embrace all kinds of light. I believe that every quality of light can be beautiful. Every time of day offers something unique in how the sun illuminates my subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, it took me a long time to embrace midday sun in photos. While I love a bright sunny day to enjoy the weather, the position of the sun and harsh nature of the shadows can make it tricky for photography.</p>
<p>What I came to realize, though, is that life happens in midday sun. In fact, some of our favorite memories happen in these light conditions. And so rather than avoiding shooting at this time, I had to start finding ways to use it to my advantage.</p>
<p>And you know what? I actually love to shoot in midday sun now! It’s <i>fun! </i>Here’s how you can fall in love with full sun photography, too.</p>

			<h2>Know the light source</h2>
<p>To know how to use any kind of light, you need to know where the light is coming from. Knowing the direction of the light will make it so that you know where your shadows will fall and allow you to adjust your subject’s position accordingly.</p>
<p>In the middle of the day, it might feel like light is coming in from everywhere. However, the light is really coming from just one place. And that’s pretty close to straight overhead.</p>
<p>Take note of how that light affects your subject’s facial features. See how it changes when you change the way your subject holds her head or when you reposition yourself above or below. Experiment with how to use shadows for interesting shapes.</p>
<p>When you take the time to really understand your light source, you will better be able to control how it affects your final photographs.</p>

			<h2>Embrace the unique qualities of full sun</h2>
<p>When shooting midday, just embrace the light full-on. Let the sun light up your subject like a big spotlight. Stop fighting the bright highlights and the deep shadows.</p>
<p>You may have heard that these things are undesirable. But we are not after dreamy backlit photos here! Instead, try to capture midday sun and highlight the time of day by using the light as it is.</p>
<p>We are not after a perfectly lit photo. Instead, we are trying to tell the story of the middle of the day. Let your colors will pop. Allow your subject to shine with the high contrast. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised by the results!</p>

			<p><i>Pro tip: Have your subject close his eyes or wear sunglasses. Midday sun can be super harsh and you don’t want anyone to damage his/her vision!</i></p>
<h2>Use shadows</h2>
<p>Midday sun is recognizable by its bright highlights and also by its harsh shadows. And where there are shadows, there can be photographic drama.</p>
<p>Watch the shadows play on your subject and use them to your advantage. Find the shapes and lines created by various objects and employ them in your final images.</p>
<p>In the image below, my daughter was at the beach at midday.I shot this at the beach, midday. I positioned her so that her face, hands, and hair would be illuminated as those were the important parts of the story I was telling. Everything else fades in dramatic shadows, letting the details I deemed important stay front and center.</p>

			<p>Shadows will also play on our environment. It’s fun to incorporate these into your images. Long shadows on walls and on the street are amazing ways to create mood and have fun.</p>
<h2>Focus on the memories</h2>
<p>Another thing I love about shooting in midday sun is that I am more present. I can relax and just shoot to catch moments as they happen.</p>
<p>Why is this? Well, in many shooting scenarios I spend a lot of time looking for “pretty” light. It is nice to get a break from the pressure of finding the best light and instead just focus on the memories that are unfolding.</p>
<p>So many special moments happen during this time of day. If you have small kids, chances are that this is when you and your family are the most active.</p>
<p>If there is something lovely happening, don’t worry too much about the light. Just take the shot and treasure the moment. I find that some of my favorite shots have happened this way.</p>

			<p>The shot above of my daughter and niece was entirely unplanned. Their hair looked so fun in the wind. While I might have once shied away from taking the shot or nudged them toward open shade, in this moment I did not think about light at all. I just focused on their connection and the movement.</p>
<p>With practice and repetition, you will find yourself subconsciously finding how to make the light work. Instead of thinking about it, it will just happen as you observe the scene in front of you.</p>

			<h2>Embrace bolder colors</h2>
<p>Another benefit of all that pretty light is that it enhances colors. There are no clouds diminishing vibrance and the color of the sunlight is more neutral than the warm hazy light of golden hour.</p>
<p>For this reason, environmental and landscape photography is great in this kind of light. I was at the lighthouse above with my family. It was quite sunny and we went up there just after lunch. The blue skies and bold shadows make the scene feel so much more three dimensional and dynamic!</p>
<h2>Find a place to hide</h2>
<p>At last, if you have had enough of all that light and beautiful sunshine, you can always find open shade. Open shade is the shadowed space that a large object creates: trees, buildings, overhangs, and garages are all good places to start.</p>
<p>If you place your subject inside the shadowed area, you are in the open shade area. Open shade is perfect to use for midday portraits. You get the benefit of the shiny light bouncing back on our subject but without all the harsh shadows of direct sunlight.</p>
<p>In this photo, I put my daughter just inside a door opening. It was around 3 o’clock in the afternoon in July. With clear blue skies this made for some pretty harsh direct sunlight!</p>

			<p>By positioning her in the shade, I diffused the light. Instead of hitting her directly in the face, the light is taking a detour by first hitting the ground in front of her and then bouncing back on her face.</p>
<p>If you can find a spot like this you can take great portraits.</p>
<p>Midday is when a lot of the best moments happen. And while the light isn’t that hazy golden hour light that we all love, it can be really beautiful in its own way. So go out and embrace full sun and capture the memories that matter to you with confidence.</p>

			<p>You always hear photographers talk about the importance of “good light.” We want shadows that add dimension. We adore glowing backlight. And we swoon for lens flare.But the truth is, “good light” isn’t always readily available! Especially in these gloomier winter months, cloudy gray skies are more likely that beautiful golden sun.</p>
<p>I used to not even bother picking up my camera when it was overcast. I hated the light and was not inspired by it at all. My camera would languish for weeks, gathering dust while life and all of its photo-worthy moments passed me by.</p>
<p>After a while I realized that I was missing too many opportunities by not taking pictures in less-than-ideal light. I finally resolved to make it work. I didn’t want to waste my time waiting for sunshine. So I set-out to learn how to work WITH the gloom instead of against it.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I realized that not only could I make overcast days work, but that these kinds of conditions could actually be favorable! So if you are like I was and used to hide from those cloudy skies, this article is for you. Here are all the reason you should love photographing on overcast days.</p>

			<h2>Gray skies mean that beautiful weather is on its way</h2>
<p>While the clouds sometimes feel a bit depressing, they can also be a sign of amazing things to come. That’s because clouds mean precipitation! And precipitation can lead to some pretty fantastic photo magic. The key is to make the weather work in your favor.</p>
<p>Overcast skies during winter here means there is a big chance of snow. And snow, my friends, is an awesome enhancer of photos. It adds interest, texture and life to any picture!</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Even better, snow is irresistibly fun for the kids! All of those smiles make for happy photos, even if the light isn’t particularly happy.</p>
<p>Think about how you can incorporate play into your photos of snow. Is it a picture of the kids sticking their tongues out to catch a snowflake? Perhaps you want to take a shot from overhead as the kids make snow angels? Or maybe it is a photo of everyone working together to make a snowman.</p>
<p>There are endless possibilities to make your pictures shine with happiness when you add snow to the mix!</p>

			<p>Of course, it isn’t always cold enough to snow, in which case those gray skies might mean that rain is on its way. This is still a great opportunity for photos!</p>
<p>Think about rain boots splashing in puddles, colorful umbrellas, and shooting through windows covered in sparkly little droplets of water. As long as you keep your gear safe from the elements, there is no reason to hide when the wet stuff comes raining down.</p>
<p>Try shooting reflections in puddles, or even photographing the clouds themselves. This is a great time to try to be creative and you may find yourself loving the results.</p>
<p>And if you are really lucky, rain can lead to RAINBOWS! One morning it was raining like crazy and it seemed as thought the deluge would never stop. But then suddenly, a double rainbow appeared!</p>
<p>The sun had come out for the briefest moment, left just as quickly, and left these magical rainbows behind. This never would have happened with out that rain and those clouds. It was like a dream and I have never seen something like it again.</p>
<p>So be prepared, you never know what magic those clouds can bring. They are often a sign of fantastic things to come.</p>

			<h2>Colors are even bolder in the midst of gloom</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->So let&#8217;s say magical rainbows don’t appear. What are we to do? Create your own rainbow of color!</p>
<p>All that dull gray begs for a pop of color and when you oblige, that color is even more beautiful. Color really works against the gray and can be made the star of the frame.</p>
<p>Try putting your subject in a bold, rich color and photograph her on an overcast day. Red look richer. Blues look deeper. And golds look bolder. The contrast of the muted light with the saturated hues can make for photo magic.</p>
<p>My daughter’s red coat against the muted hues ensures that my viewer is sure to see her as the focus of the photo. It’s a simple concept but makes all the difference when the sun isn’t at it’s most glorious.</p>

			<h2>Shape the light for beautiful portraits</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->If the outdoors are gloomy, stay inside! Overcast days are a perfect opportunity to play with window light and create some beautiful portraits.</p>
<p>By using the light as it shines through the shape of a window, you are no longer working with the sun overhead. Instead, you are working with a rectangular light source positioned on the wall.</p>
<p>Try moving your subject closer to the window, farther from the window, and behind, below, above, and in front of the window. Observe what happens to the light and shadows on his face as he moves. When you see results you love, take a photo!</p>
<p>I love using this concept in my carport. It gives me the most beautiful, soft, directional light. I make my kids pose here all the time! It is the same concept as the window, but now the rectangle of my light source is much larger. It makes for beautiful soft shadows and it’s my favorite spot for a portrait.</p>

			<h2>Take advantage of nature&#8217;s softbox</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->Clouds are a great diffuser of light. The sun is an amazing light source and the clouds complement it by taking of the hard edges of midday sun.</p>
<p>A cloudy sky is basically a huge softbox and if you are positioned right, the light is amazingly flattering. Having your subject straight up to the sky lights up the face beautifully.</p>
<p>The light is flat and that makes for especially flattering results. While I do love directional light, there is definitely a place for flat light in my workflow. This kind of light minimizes blemishes and wrinkles because it doesn’t emphasize texture.</p>
<p>Try playing with different perspectives using this diffused light and see if you find an angle that is most flattering. You will be delighted to find that the clouds can remove a lot of the challenges that you might face on a bright sunny day!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->So don’t despair at the gloom! Instead, take the optimists approach and find all the ways that clouds and gray skies can benefit your photography. This kind of creative challenge is always good and you might just get results that you adore!</p>

			<p>The human face is one of the most photographed subjects in the history of the craft. It is our first means of identifying each other. It is how we first read emotion. Every combination of features is unique and provides a wealth of information to those observing it. A face is our introduction to a person and so it makes sense that a portrait would be a photographer’s first choice in introducing her subject in an image.</p>
<p>However, there are times when excluding a face can tell us more about a person or a scene than including it. The anonymity of a faceless image can invoke new emotions. It can allow the viewer to place him/herself in the scene. It can force us to focus on details that we might otherwise miss.</p>
<p>I love shooting faceless images. I enjoy the challenge of giving my viewer as much information as possible without facial features present in the frame.

			<h2>Hair</h2>
<p>Hair is a highly effective tool in revealing details about a subject without including his/her face. It can at times give us clues as to gender, age, style, and personality. Movement can be depicted through strands of hair blowing in the breeze or flying out from behind a subject in motion. Hair can imply emotion through its ability to change styles, follow the physical lead of its owner, and hide or reveal the face of a subject.</p>
<p>I love to use hair when possible (and my daughter has alot of it!). I am enamored with its ability to show movement in a still photograph. The way it flows lends a sense of magic to my imagery the way fields of wheat angled by the wind or waves in an ocean lend magic to a landscape.</p>
<p>Even more, I have experienced firsthand how hair can be a significant part of a personality. My daughter’s hair is long and blonde and she is proud of it! Observing her flip it around all the time reveals her girly, playful side and I am always seeking to capture that.</p>
<p>When creating your own anonymous portraits, consider how hair can be used to convey different emotions. In the photo above I used it in more of a happy way. The sun is shining, and my subject is happy and spinning with her hair flying out all around her.</p>
<p>By contrast, hair covering the face creates a sense of drama and guardedness. Having someone’s hair cover his or her face can lend a sense of mystery. Consider if your subject bends her head down with hair covering her face. Without features to piece together an expression, we are left to wonder what she is feeling. Is she sad? Is she angry? Explore that in your photography!</p>

			<p>I took this shot for Sweden’s National Day. I am particularly drawn to the contrast between my daughters covered face and the bright happy colors of the flowers and flag.</p>
<h2>Shadows</h2>
<p>Another way to cover the face in a photography is to get dramatic with shadows. Whether concealing only a portion of the face of leaving all features in darkness, shadows can add mystery and drama to a portrait while simultaneously revealing details that might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
<p>The ways in which you can employ shadows in your work are limitless. Use your imagination and break the rules! Look for harsh light and things that can cast unique shadows such as buildings, trees, or blinds. Move your subject around within these patterns to get the effect you desire.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Your subject can even create the shadow him/herself! Place your subject in front of a brightly lit area and capture a silhouette. Capture your subject’s cast shadow on a wall or on the ground.</p>
<p>See how body language becomes incredibly important in these images. Without facial features to give us information about the subject, we look to how the arms and legs and head are held to decipher the emotion of the scene.</p>
<p>Experiment with your subjects practicing different kinds of activities in these shadowed photographs. Running, dancing, spinning, and jumping are all dynamic movements that lend themselves well to being captured in shadow. Allow yourself to observe and be creative and don’t be afraid to try something new!</p>

			<h2>Imperfect reflections</h2>
<p>Reflections can create a somewhat distorted version of a subject. Consider how a less-than-perfect mirror, a body of water, or foggy glass renders your own reflection. You can use these imperfections to create impactful faceless portraits.</p>
<p>Of course you can see someone’s face quite well if the surface is reflecting clearly, so a window may not be the best way to get a faceless portrait. Seek reflective surfaces that naturally lends themselves to anonymity.</p>

			<p>In this photograph, the puddle did not provide a clear reflection. I saw it and knew it was perfect for an anonymous portrait! I love how a puddle simultaneously reveals just a bit of what is below and what is above. It is almost like a visit from the other side. It can be intriguing or scary all at once depending on the subject and the audience.</p>
<h2>Intentionally covered</h2>
<p>Who has a kid who loves playing dress-up? Take advantage of that now! I loved when my children were younger and would spend hours in their sweet little costumes. Not only do those costumes act as a great motivator to get your kids in front of the camera, but you can also use them to create anonymity in a photograph!</p>
<p>Find costumes with hats, hoods, or masks that can at least partially cover the face (superhero costumes are always a good pick!). You can even create your own costumes with items around the house. Blankets, boxes, buckets and more are all amazing costumes in the right hands.</p>

			<p>Only your imagination sets the limits with how you capture your costumed subjects. Let their personalities and personas take flight as they hide beneath their disguises. You might just be surprised at how that shy one shines from behind a mask!</p>
<h2>Shooting from behind</h2>
<p>This may seem obvious, but having your subject face away from the camera is a great way to keep his/her face out of the frame.</p>
<p>However, taking a shot of someone from behind can do more in an image than simply keep it anonymous. It can also give the image a sense of direction.</p>

			<p>Consider how the subject’s averted gaze might affect the viewers of your photograph. They might see the subject as heading somewhere or looking forward to something. The might further consider where the subject is and where she is going. More than they would in a traditional portrait, they might question what has the subject’s attention and explore that more within the frame.</p>
<p>It is here where you can make some creative choices to guide your viewer to more mystery or to answers. Do you want to include context? Then maybe a wide angle lens would be a good choice to include as much of the surroundings as possible. Do you want to create a sense of uncertainty? Perhaps you should consider a closer crop or a perfectly clean scene where the audience cannot answer the questions of where and why. This is where you get to be the artist and guide your audience through your imagery in an intentional way.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only the beginning of the ways that you can begin to explore faceless portraiture. More than anything, I want you to have fun being creative and experimenting as you explore this fun way of seeing your subjects in a new way.</p>

			<p>When you think of backlight, you often think of beautiful settings outside.</p>
<p>But is outdoors the only option for backlighting your images?</p>
<p>Absolutely not! This is how I use backlight indoors&#8230;</p>
<h2>Find the best window(s).</h2>
<p>So first thing&#8217;s first, just like when you use backlight outdoors, you have to find the right spot for backlight indoors. That means locating a window that will give you the backlight you want.</p>
<p>I prefer to use bright sunlight when backlighting indoors but soft, cloudy light works, too. I&#8217;ll get back to that.</p>
<p>So take a look around your house. What do your windows look like? When does the sun shine through them and how does it look? What time of the day during what time of the year is the sun low enough to shine in the right place?</p>
<p>Our house has lots of good sized windows but only one where the sun shines the right way so I can use it for backlight. It&#8217;s an east facing window. This is important because the direction of the window will give you a clue where the sun will be.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s only during early spring and early fall the the light will fall into this window low enough to use it for backlight! So in July, when the sun basically never sets here, it&#8217;s way too high to use for backlight at this window.</p>
<p>So, both seasons and time of day matter. This is my child hanging out in my favorite window on a glorious but freezing winter day. Perfect for indoor backlight!</p>

			<h2>Utilize strong light.</h2>
<p>This kind of direct light is also fun to play with and you can get really creative with it.</p>
<p>I always make my daughter do hair flips because it looks ah-mazing in backlight. She has gotten so used to me asking, that she just does it anyway now.</p>
<p>This is not the best light for portraits so it&#8217;s fun use your imagination. Sometimes light is your main subject and this is the perfect time for that.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is underexposing your backlit images so you don&#8217;t lose too much detail in the highlights. Then you can easily recover your shadows when editing.</p>

			<h2>Soft light works, too.</h2>
<p>If you live in a country where the sun doesn&#8217;t shine for most of the year like I do, you can still backlight with softer light.</p>
<p>One thing to think about is what is outside the window because that will be much more visible with soft light. In this shot I had to clone out a few bits and pieces of my neighbours red tiles to get the clean look I wanted.</p>
<p>With this kind of light you have to be careful not to underexpose as you will end up with a silhouette. It&#8217;s so different from a sunny day but still so dreamy!</p>

			<h2>Use currents to eliminate distractions.</h2>
<p>Different fabrics or curtains are a great way of enhancing a backlit indoor photo. It can also take away from distractions in the background.</p>
<p>In the following photo, the distractions of the windows on the building in the background are a bit obscured by the curtains. They also add some texture and lines.</p>
<p>Texture and lines are usually interesting to look at. I intentionally underexposed this shot because I like drama and it makes the backlight pop.</p>

			<h2>Be ready when you&#8217;re on family outings.</h2>
<p>So I realise that windows like the ones above can be hard to come by. They are certainly not in your everyday home. But when you do come across them, the result can be magical.</p>
<p>I took this next shot at the <a href="http://www.polin.pl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POLIN Museum</a> in Warsaw. We ended up here by chance and I never would&#8217;ve imagined that I would run into a window with this magical light.</p>
<p>Luckily, I bring my camera everywhere. And you should, too!</p>
<p>Go to your local library or museum. It&#8217;s also be an excuse to get out with your family. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a grand museum in a big city, these places are everywhere. My point is that you need to look for light and opportunity and you need to be prepared when you find it.</p>
<p>On a final note, when shooting backlight, just taking a step to the side can change the image completely.</p>
<p>If I had taken a step to the left at the POLIN Museum, I would have had an image that was full of direct sunlight. It would&#8217;ve been a very different image.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of backlight, it&#8217;s so versatile. So find a good window and work some magic!</p>
