			<p>We all have that place where we feel as though we are in equilibrium with our environment. For me, that is the mountains. Well, it doesn’t even have to be mountains &#8211; woods, trails, hilltops…..they all soothe my soul in such a beautiful way.</p>
<p>I love to hike with my family, all of us out there together taking in the fresh air. It’s so restorative for me to step away from it all and simply be in the mountains.</p>

			<p>I have a special affection for black and white photos. For a while I was almost exclusively a black and white photographer, and although I do a pretty even mix of color and black and white now, nothing sings to my heart quite like an emotive black and white image.</p>
<p>I just love the way black and white imagery strips everything away but the raw emotion of the moment.</p>

			<p>I absolutely love my <a href="https://chatbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chatbooks subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Every time I post 60 photos to my personal Instagram account they send an adorable hard-cover book to my door. I have it set up to also print the date and my original caption, so the whole story of my post comes with the book.</p>
<p>The best part is that I don’t have to do anything! So whether it’s one of my daily 365 photos or it’s a random selfie with my kids, these cute little books ensure that the images get off my computer and into our lives.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Skiing is without a doubt my favorite sport. I raced Slalom and Giant Slalom through college, so it’s been a bit part of my life for a long time.</p>
<p>My husband and I love to escape for some serious ski adventure when we can, but in this phase of our lives we are just as happy cruising down our local ski mountain with the kids. The best part about skiing is that it’s one of the few sports you can do together as a whole family, and I cherish our time together out there on the mountain.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>My grandmother will be 95 in two weeks. She is one of my best friends and one of the most influential people in my life.</p>
<p>My grandmother truly sees the beauty in everything. She has shaped my outlook on life so significantly and has taught me what is means to truly be comfortable in your own skin.</p>
<p>This beautiful woman is the perfect balance of self love &#8211; not too little that she has given up but not too much that she is afraid of Father Time, for she truly embraces all that each passing year brings. Whether its new great-grandchildren or new wrinkles, she is grateful for what accompanies each new day. She has a perfect love for who she is and what she’s experienced in this life (which is an absolutely incredible and inspiring story that could be a movie of its own…..).</p>
<p>I love this picture because it captures her so well &#8211; my grandmother embraces all that aging brings but knows at 95 years young she still deserves a nice coat of lipstick before heading out.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>My <a href="https://amzn.to/2HbOWKy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 35mm ART lens</a> is on my camera 95% of the time. I photograph everything with this lens! Portraits, detail shots, landscape &#8211; this lens does it all.</p>
<p>To keep up with my 365 project, my <a href="https://amzn.to/2J78oIW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon D750</a> lives on my counter with my Sigma 35mm ART attached to it. One of the things I love about this lens is the way I can get in really close to my subject, becoming part of the moment with them.</p>
<p>This lens it tack-sharp and when it&#8217;s wide open (I’m usually at f/1.4-2.8), it creates a really gorgeous softness around the area of focus. This allows me to beautifully isolate one element of a scene, such as a small child’s hands on his mother’s back.</p>
<p>If I had to pick only one lens to use for the rest of my journey it would undoubtedly be the Sigma 35mm ART.</p>

			<p>I keep a small vegetable garden in my backyard that consists of three raised beds filled will peas, beans, cucumber, tomato and a few other vegetables.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do on a summer evening is to work in my garden as the setting sun is shimmering through the trees. My kids usually join me, enjoying the fruits of our labor right from the garden.</p>
<p>I also love to head to my garden very early in the morning before the rest of the house wakes. I often bring my macro lens with me, and this is a very meditative time for me. There’s just something so soothing about digging my hands in the dirt and growing the food I put on the table for dinner.</p>

			<p>Adjusting color is a very powerful component in editing.</p>
<p>When you import an image as a <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/why-you-should-shoot-in-raw-instead-of-jpeg-by-megan-squires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAW file</a> it appears a bit flat. Lightroom is your tool to bring out the color and bring the image to life!</p>
<p>Undeniably, it&#8217;s the quality of your exposure that has the greatest impact on color. However, beyond that, color is largely impacted by the following five areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/white-balance-comparing-the-different-ways-to-set-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Balance</a></li>
<li>Camera Calibration and Color Profile</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/how-to-use-the-hsl-panel-in-lightroom-to-get-good-skin-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSL Panel</a></li>
<li>Color Curves</li>
<li>Split toning</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to adjust each of these for every image that you take. But it&#8217;s important to understand the role that each plays in the potential outcome of your image.</p>
<p>Today, let’s spend a little more time talking about Color Curves and the impact they have on your editing.</p>
<h2>First, let’s back up….</h2>
<p>Color Curves are located within the Tone Curve in Lightroom. The Tone Curve is arguably one of the most powerful tools in Lightroom. The Tone Curve represents all the tones of your image.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>The bottom of the Tone Curve is the Tone axis: the line starts with Shadows on the left and ends with Highlights on the right. In the middle you have Midtones, which are then further split into darker midtones, called Darks, and brighter Midtones, called Lights. The left axis represents how bright or dark the specific tonal regions are. The further up the left axis you go, the brighter the tones get.</p>
<p>Within the tone curve, you can select RGB (all the colors) or you can select the tone curve for each specific color (Red, Green, Blue). Adjusting the RGB curve really gives the image a lot of depth, and, as such, it&#8217;s often the best place to start within the Tone Curve.</p>
<p>To adjust the Tone Curve you can either use the region sliders or you can drag on the Tone Curve itself to pull it into the desired shape. To do this, you must first click the box in the lower right corner of the tone curve so that the sliders go away.</p>
<p>For example, I like images with deep blacks and strong whites so I prefer to deepen my shadows and brighten the lights a bit. To do this, I almost always create a version of the classic “S” curve (dragging the lower third down a bit and raising the upper third just slightly). The S curve deepens the shadows and brightens the lighter portions, really helping the image pop.</p>

			<h2>So, how do color curves work?</h2>
<p>The color curves in Lightroom allows you to fine-tune the color for specific regions of your image. For example, you can adjust the blues in your shadows or the reds in your midtones.</p>
<p>You adjust color curves the same way you adjust the Tone Curve. Use the Targeted Adjustment Tool to select an area of the image. A dot will then appear on the tone curve in that spot. You can then either use the up/down keys or drag the dot to where you want it.</p>
<p>Note: It helps to also pay attention to your RGB numbers on your top histogram to make sure you have them where you want them.</p>
<p>When deciding what direction to adjust your Color Curve remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red is the opposite of cyan.</li>
<li>Green is the opposite of magenta.</li>
<li>Blue is the opposite of yellow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing any one of those colors using Color Curves, increases that color’s opposite.</p>

			<p>Color Curves can be especially helpful when correcting skin tones.</p>
<p>You can certainly adjust skin tones with a white balance adjustment but if this doesn&#8217;t get you the look you&#8217;re going for, the Color Curves may have a more accurate result.</p>
<p>With Color Curves you can adjust the color for a limited part of the tonal range versus the global adjustment you get with the temperature slider. For example, if your shadows are overly red you can reduce the red in the shadows through the color curve without impacting red globally.</p>

			<p>Overall, it was a relatively straightforward edit that got most if it’s impact through the Color Curves.</p>
<h2>It’s a slow process… save a preset!</h2>
<p>Adjusting color curves can take a lot of time. So when you find a color recipe that works for you, it can be helpful to save it as a preset. You can then use this as a starting point for your images and fine tune the curve as each individual image necessitates.</p>
<p>To do this, click on the “+” button at the top of your Presets Panel on the left column of Lightroom. When the preset box pops up, just make sure you only check “Tone Curve” so that when you use this on other images, your preset is adjusting the Tone Curve only.</p>

			<h2>Do I always need to do this?</h2>
<p>Using the Tone Curve is an essential part of every edit. I adjust the RGB curve with every single image as I believe this is the best way to add depth through processing.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Color Curves may not always be necessary but it&#8217;s important to remember that it&#8217;s another area you can use to fine-tune and add impact to your image.</p>
<p>And of course, there’s no right or wrong way to edit color. Each session has its own unique feel, and accordingly, its own unique color edit.</p>
<p>What is most important is that you understand all the tools available to you within Lightroom so that you can take full creative control over the direction of your edit.</p>

			<p>I’m a Lightroom girl.</p>
<p>I do 95% of my editing within that program.</p>
<p>Lightroom gives me the full creative power I need to bring my images to life.</p>
<p>However, there are a few situations where Photoshop can deliver a result that is stronger or faster than what I  can do in Lightroom. In these situations, I do my Lightroom work first and then I bring the image over to Photoshop for a quick fix.</p>
<p>Once my Photoshop fix is done, I bring the image back to Lightroom to finalize and export.</p>
<h2>Before heading into Photoshop</h2>
<p>Before heading into Photoshop to make any of the below edits, I first complete my Lightroom edit. I work my way down the Develop panel making both global and local adjustments, ensuring that I have the color or black and white conversion as I want it.</p>
<p>Once I’m satisfied with the overall edit, I take the image into Photoshop for some final fine-tuning and polish.</p>
<p>For those of you new to Photoshop, to take an image into Photoshop from Lightroom simply right click on the image thumbnail on the bottom of your screen and click “Edit in Photoshop”.</p>
<p>Once the image opens in Photoshop right click on the initial layer of the image and click “duplicate layer”. This will leave your original image in tact underneath your edits in the event that you want to undo some of your changes.</p>
<p>When you are done making your edits, simply click “save” and it will automatically save the image back down to Lightroom.</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Photoshop fix #1: Spot removal</span></h3>
<p>While the spot removal tool in Lightroom has improved with each Lightroom update, nothing is quicker and smoother at removing spots than the Spot Healing Brush Tool in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a scratch, a flyaway hair or newborn baby acne, I find the Spot Healing Brush Tool to be quicker and more accurate than the spot removal tool in Lightroom.</p>
<p>After taking the image into Photoshop, click on the <b>Spot Healing Brush</b> tool. You can use the key that looks like this “[“ to make the correction circle smaller, or “]” to make the circle bigger.</p>
<p>You can click on a single spot to erase it, or drag the tool to erase something longer like a scratch on the skin. This brush automatically samples from the area around the imperfection to ensure the correction is a proper color match.</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Photoshop fix #2: Patch tool for removing unwanted objects</span></h3>
<p>The Patch Tool is great for repairing larger areas or for removing distracting elements within your image that may not correct as well with the Spot Healing Brush.</p>
<p>The Patch Tool is located in the same spot as the Spot Healing Brush tool. Right click on the Spot Healing brush and select the <b>Patch Tool</b> from the menu.</p>
<p>To use this tool begin by drawing a circle around the area you wish to correct. Then drag this area in any direction toward the part of the image you would like to correct with. (Note: Check to see that “<b>Source</b>” is selected in the upper menu bar before dragging the selection).</p>
<p>Photoshop then blends the pixels from the destination area into the original selection, erasing the unwanted object.</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Photoshop fix #3: Eyes that sparkle</span></h3>
<p>There are many ways to enhance the eyes, but I’ll walk you through one method that is relatively quick and straightforward, but yields captivating results.</p>
<p>After taking the image into Photoshop, click on the <b>Magnifying Glass</b> to zoom in on the eyes of the image. Then click on the <b>Magnetic Lasso </b>tool.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite tools in Photoshop because it makes selecting any part of the image super quick and easy. (Note: If you are only seeing the Lasso tool and not the Magnetic Lasso, right click on the Lasso and a small menu will appear with the Magnetic Lasso option.)</p>
<p>Using the Magnetic Lasso select the area around the eye. To select both eyes at the same time, after completely circling one eye, hold down the <b>Shift</b> key and then circle the other eye.</p>

			<p>Once both eyes are selected go to <b>Layer -&gt; New Layer Via Copy</b> on the top menu.</p>
<p>Then go to <b>Filter -&gt; Other -&gt; High Pass</b>. The High Pass filter is a sharpening filter that gives very nice results when used carefully and selectively. I usually set the High Pass filter to 10, and then adjust the opacity as necessary in the layer panel if 10 makes the eyes look unnatural.</p>
<p>After clicking on High Pass, the eyes will look foggy, so you will then want to go to the Layer panel, and change your layer blending mode to <b>Soft Light</b>.</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Photoshop fix #4: Content aware fill to extend your background</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes you may find yourself needing just a bit more sky or background than you actually shot. For example, your client may request an image that you captured in a 4&#215;6 ratio as an 8&#215;10, and to print properly at this size without changing the vision you had for the image, you may need to extend your background.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this in Photoshop is with <b>Content Aware Fill</b>. After opening the image in Photoshop, click on the <b>Crop</b> tool.</p>
<p>From there, simply drag on the part of the image you would like to extend. If it’s the sky, drag the crop up until you reach the size you need. If you find the whole image is continuing to move at the same scale you started with, click the <b>Clear</b> button on the top menu bar.</p>
<p>On the top menu bar you will also want to make sure <b>Content Aware</b> is checked. Then hit enter and the tool will automatically fill the area in using the information it has gathered from the pixels around it.</p>

			<p>Light and shadows, and the contrasts between them, are my muses.</p>
<p>High-contrast light is full of life and emotion… emotion that transcends that particular moment, and moves and changes as the image is absorbed by different eyes.</p>
<p>Both light and dark work in perfect synchronicity to create a feeling that there is more to what lies within the image than what is visually present.</p>
<p>More than any other visual element, it is shadows that I am drawn to. Shadows play their part in letting light shine, while leaving just a bit of uncertainty in the image&#8230; giving the imagination a place to go. Through the use of shadows, the image is infused with depth and feeling, making the moment the star of the image.</p>

<p>Below are five tips to help you embrace the shadows to create emotive black and white images.</p>
<h2>1. Find the emotion in the moment</h2>
<p>Visual interpretation of the scene is the root of all emotive images. It’s important to pause, observe and take in what is before you, allowing to you to truly feel the moment. If you walk into a room and see your child playing with a toy, how you interpret that moment will dictate all of your shooting and processing choices. You may notice that the light is a little bit stronger on the side of his body, illuminating his young profile and accentuating the concentration on his toy. With your eyes on this slight illumination, you can then make camera and positioning choices that will truly draw out the depth of the scene before you.</p>
<p>Try It: This is an exercise for your eyes only. Just sit in the room with your child, or in a field of flowers at sunset, or on a busy city street. Observe and take it in. Watch how the light changes as you move around within the scene. Look for that perfect highlight, those rich tones. Find the place in the scene where the moment truly speaks to what you are feeling.</p>

<h2>2. Contrast is key</h2>
<p>Sometimes I say that I “see in black in white”, but that is only part of the truth. It is often the colors I see and contrasts between them that draw me to black and white. When these colors are converted to tones &#8211; that is when I am able to draw out the true emotion in the image. All elements of a scene carry a different luminance – grass, sky, skin, clothing. When converted to B&amp;W the varying luminance of these elements means the difference between an image that will be deep and rich verses one that will feel flat. A deep, emotive image should have a least one element that will convert to bright white, several that convert to deep blacks, with the rest falling across the range of gray between. If the image is only composed of colors that convert to middle gray, it’s going to lack a lot of depth. Similarly, you need contrast between light and dark. If everything in your scene is bright and light, the B&amp;W may appear washed out. An emotive black and white is often rooted in the contrast between light and dark.</p>
<p>Try It: Within your home try photographing a still object or a child surrounded by similar tones (either via their clothing or surroundings), and then again against colors that create contrast. Notice the difference in the depth of the image when converted to black and white. Also try photographing flowers just inside your kitchen window in the morning when there is only a small amount of light coming in, thus resulting in a strong contrast between light and dark. Then try this again midday when the room is filled with light.  Notice the difference in how the image feels.</p>

<h2>3. Using the light</h2>
<p>When creating deep, emotive B&amp;W images, using a single light source can help draw out the depth in the image – a lone window illuminating the kitchen table, a glowing lamp by the bedside, the setting sun kissing the top of the flowers in a garden. With a single light source, shadows become hard and much more defined. It’s also helpful if the light falls off sharply in the image….for example, standing on the edge of a wooded area or just inside a garage. How you use the light around you and where you position yourself within it really matters. It’s especially important to understand how light moves and changes throughout the day and the effect this will have on your images.</p>
<p>Try It: Get to know the light around you. Take a photo inside your home every hour from sunrise to sunset for a whole day. See how the light changes and where it can be found. Notice when the light is most dynamic, when your colors are strong vs washed out, and how the light fall-off impacts your image.</p>

<h2>4. Knowing what to expose for</h2>
<p>In order to draw out all the depth in the shadows without losing any clarity in the highlights and midtones, proper exposure is everything. More specifically, you must know WHAT to expose for so that you can most effectively communicate your vision. A child picking a flower just before sunset is going to have a very different feel to it if you expose for the sky verses exposing for her skin. Expose for her skin and although you may have a pretty portrait, the sky is likely to be over-exposed and lacking of detail; expose for the sky and the child will become more of a silhouette. When shooting for emotive imagery, it is helpful to expose for the brightest spot in the scene, such as the sky, or sunlight touching a lone flower, or rim light along a child’s face. To ensure you don’t lose any of the details within the shadows, check your histogram on the back of the camera making sure you have not clipped any of the blacks.</p>
<p>Try It: Place your subject in an area of high contrast light (for example, in a pocket of bright light just before sunset). Try exposing the image for the brightest spot in the scene (for example, the light falling onto the child’s hair), and again for a midtone and notice the difference in the depth of the image. The sharp contrast between light and dark is going to give a very different feel to the images depending on what you exposed for.</p>

<h2>5. Processing it</h2>
<p>Lightroom is a powerful tool for editing black and white images. After doing a basic clean-up, move down to the tone curve – this is where your image will really come alive. When processing emotive images, you will want some version of the classic “S” curve (dragging the lower third down a bit and raising the upper third just slightly). The S curve deepens the shadows and brightens the lighter portions, really helping the image pop. From there move down to the luminance sliders. Moving these sliders around can really help draw out beautiful contrast in your image. Bump up your orange slider to brighten skin a bit, drop down your green to deepen the grass around a playing child. Fine-tune the image, by using an adjustment brush to dodge and burn specific areas until the image has the overall look you envisioned when you took it.</p>
<p>Try It: Processing is all practice. The more you play around in Lightroom, the more you will zero in on the adjustments that speak to you and your style of shooting. Once you have a consistent look to your black and whites that you love, save time by creating your own preset. From there it’s just one click, some minor tweaks and brush adjustments, and you’ve got your deep emotive image.</p>
