										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 4 pm and you are up to your ears in laundry, there are dishes piled high in the sink, your kids are destroying your house in record speeds, the phone won&#8217;t stop ringing, you&#8217;re wondering what you&#8217;re going to make for dinner, you have two sessions to edit and orders to fulfill, not to mention 8 gazillion emails to respond to. . .and what are you doing?  Sitting in la-la land on Facebook (or insert other mindless activity) to avoid the mile-long list of things you need to accomplish before tomorrow&#8217;s insanity begins.  Sound familiar?  Such is the life of a work-at-home mom/photographer.</p>
<p>I LOVE my job and I always try to remember how blessed I am to be able to work from home, but it&#8217;s been a serious journey in learning how to balance my family life in the middle of the chaos of running a business.   When you work AWAY from home, you focus on work, and then leave it there and go home to enjoy time with your family (I&#8217;m not saying working away from home doesn&#8217;t present its own challenges).  Working from home has it&#8217;s serious perks, but mixing work life with home life can be a recipe for disaster.  It&#8217;s really important to set boundaries to ensure the madness does not overtake you and send you to an early grave.</p>
<p>Do I always do it perfectly now that with all I&#8217;ve learned?  Heck no!!! I&#8217;m definitely a right-brained creature and as a right-brained creature,  I lose focus easily and forget to stay on task a lot!  BUT, I have gotten much better and don&#8217;t have nearly as many melt-downs as when I first started.  When I say melt-downs, I am including myself, my husband, and my kids. Here are some tips that have helped me over time, that in turn, might help you learn to balance the chaos of working from home.</p>
<h2><strong>Find a Vice.</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, so a lot of people might not agree with this one, but I think it saves me from the brink of insanity most days.  The dictionary says a vice is &#8220;a habitual and usually trivial defect or shortcoming.&#8221;  I say in my case, it&#8217;s a &#8220;habitual and usually trivial advantage or virtue.&#8221;  Okay, that might be a long-shot, but you get my  drift.  If you know me at all, you probably even know what my vice is and are really sick of me talking about it!  It&#8217;s the ever-elusive Iced Coffee beverage, combined with a sweet hint of vanilla Syrup, complete with a delicious blend of cream.   It&#8217;s something I look forward to very much and something that brings me simple joy in each day.  What&#8217;s your vice?  Please don&#8217;t go out and take up smoking or gambling lol!  I just think it&#8217;s important to have something small you look forward to each day that is just for YOU.  Whether it be a show you&#8217;ve DVR&#8217;d or a piece of dark chocolate or a mindless magazine to thumb through, find something that makes you able to stop and breathe!</p>
<h2><strong>Keep a calendar.</strong></h2>
<p>This one may seem like a given, but when I first started my business, I did not keep track of things on a calendar.  I kept track of them on little pieces of paper and in my head.  How do you think that worked out? Not so great.  I quickly learned that I needed a calendar to keep track of the numerous activities I had going on.  I use Microsoft Outlook and it updates on my iPad and iPhone automatically with Mobile Me.  Sweet, huh?</p>
<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff.</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you’ve got to just let that laundry pile up or let those dirty dishes ferment in your sink.  It&#8217;s important to use that extra time to spend time with your family and those dishes will still be there tomorrow (unfortunately).  One thing I&#8217;ve done to help the madness is to have someone come and clean my house once every two weeks.  This way I still have a semi-clean house (even if it is clean for 24 hours once every two weeks) and I am not stressed about cleaning when I could be hanging out with the kids.  Take the time every month or couple of months to input your expenses and income on a spread-sheet.  This will save you A LOT of stress come tax-time.  Not all of the stress unfortunately, because tax-time is still a not-so-fun situation, but at least you won&#8217;t be buried alive in receipts in come April 14.   I know some super organized people keep track of these things as soon as they happen  but you can&#8217;t fit a square peg in a round hole so I do what I can.</p>
<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t mix your working space with your living space.</strong></h2>
<p>I know this is one that you might not be willing to give up, but I think it&#8217;s been really positive for me.  I do my editing and other computer work in my office instead of upstairs in my main living area.  This keeps me from being on the computer 24-7 and also keeps me more focused when I&#8217;m actually doing business-related tasks.  It also helps me escape work in a sense, instead of it being &#8220;there&#8221; all of the time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-4822 aligncenter" title="clickmagazinepicture" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/clickmagazinepicture-e1313081040976.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<h2><strong>Work smarter, not harder.</strong></h2>
<p>Try to outsource things or use more automation.   Some things I use to edit faster are Lightroom and Auto-loader.   It has cut my editing time in half!  Next on my agenda (which might mean 2 years) is finding an assistant to handle everything for me but the shooting and editing.   Of course, you want to keep things in the realm of what you can afford, but it can be really good to give some of the things up that eat up your working hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Above all, breathe.</strong></h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve become a society that is so out-of-control busy, that we forget life is about making meaningful memories, rather than running around 24-7 like a chicken with its head cut off.  Try to remember what&#8217;s important and to remember the big picture of life.  We are only granted the luxury of our existence here on earth once and we don&#8217;t get a do-over.  It&#8217;s something I try and remind myself of every day.   Remember, you can only die once!</p>
<p>Happy Balancing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me preface these tips by saying I absolutely ADORE shooting at the beach. I love the backdrop, the sand, the skies, the piers, the lifeguard towers, etc. But I didn&#8217;t always love it and it used to make me VERY nervous. After doing many upon many shoots there, I thought I&#8217;d share some tips that have helped me immensely in getting the results I want with beach pictures.</p>
<h4>1. Timing is EVERYTHING.</h4>
<p>I normally shoot at the beach in the hour or two before sunset. The lighting at this time is gorgeous and you don&#8217;t have to fight that harsh overhead lighting. I get my best portraits in front of the water about 20 minutes before sunset. I have seen gorgeous beach pictures at all different times of the day, but I prefer this time and 99% of the time schedule my sessions around it.</p>
<h4>2. Find a beach that has more to offer than just sand and ocean!</h4>
<p>I love to offer a variety to my clients so I love shooting at beaches that offer different &#8220;backdrops&#8221;. One of my favorite beaches has a really cool pier and some green ice plant that adds texture, color, and an interesting background to the pictures. Another one has some sand dunes and a beautiful hotel in the background that is really well-known in my area.</p>
<h4>3. Embrace the haze!</h4>
<p>I didn&#8217;t always love the haze the beach brings to my pictures, but I have learned to work with it and now embrace it with each session I do at the beach. I&#8217;ve found my processing is often different and may require more attention than other kinds of lighting, but it adds a whimsy, carefree feel to the photos when done right.</p>
<p><a href="http://kristinrachellephotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/san-diego-family-photographer-sv5.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" title="Click the image to open in full size." src="http://kristinrachellephotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/san-diego-family-photographer-sv5.jpg" alt="Click the image to open in full size." height="600" border="0" /></a></p>
<h4>4. Use a lens hood!</h4>
<p>There can be too much of a good thing when it comes to haze. Using a lens hood can help you cut down on some of the intense haze you might experience shooting at the beach.</p>
<h4>5. Spot metering can be your friend with back lighting.</h4>
<p>You can expose for the face and get much better results than using evaluative/matrix metering. I would much rather blow out the background a bit than having a subject with a severely underexposed face! Can you say processing nightmare?!?!!?</p>
<h4>6. That being said , you can also underexpose a bit to preserve the color.</h4>
<p>If the sky is magical the evening of a session, I want to showcase that! Sometimes I will intentionally underexpose my subjects just a bit (not too much because then you introduce a lot of noise). If you blow out a sky, there is no bringing it back in your processing. I use Lightroom so I&#8217;m able to use the many tools it offers to keep my exposure right where I want it.</p>
<h4>7. Silhouettes rock!</h4>
<p>Meter for the sky and start shooting! I love capturing the vivid colors in the sky around sunset time and it makes your subject(s) pop! It certainly adds a fun dimension to your gallery. One of my fave pictures of my own family is a silhouette a friend and fellow photographer took for us.<br />

<h4>8. Use a wide angle lens for some of your shots.</h4>
<p>MANY of my favorite portraits at the beach were taken with my fisheye lens. It adds a unique and fun approach to beach pictures.</p>
<p><a href="http://kristinrachellephotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/san-diego-family-photographer-ew1.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" title="Click the image to open in full size." src="http://kristinrachellephotography.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/san-diego-family-photographer-ew1.jpg" alt="Click the image to open in full size." width="600" border="0" /></a></p>
<h4>9. Be careful with your equipment!</h4>
<p>I once dropped my 24-70L right into the wet sand when changing to a different lens. I think the seagulls stopped flying mid-air and waves froze mid-crash to see what would happen next. Even though I wanted too, I didn&#8217;t break down in tears and raise my hands to the sky yelling &#8220;WHY ME?!?!&#8221;. Thankfully, my lens was ok, but I sure learned my lesson!!!!</p>
<h4>10. Last but definitely not least. . . HAVE FUN!</h4>
<p>Let your subjects play! Kids being themselves and being happy create the best portraits of all. Have their mom or dad throw them in the air, have them race, or have them dance like crazy people. This goes for adults too, I think we grow up and assume we need to be serious for pictures but that is NOT TRUE people! I love to make my subject&#8217;s feel comfortable and at ease, so heck, I&#8217;ll dance for them if I need too!  Genuine smiles and laughter caught in pictures makes me feel I&#8217;ve done my job.</p>
