<p>Spring is such a perfect time to practice macro photography!</p>
<p>The weather is finally warming up for many of us and we can get outside, enjoy some sunshine, and look for blooms and signs of new life.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite tips and tricks for macro photography, along with gorgeous illustrative images from the fabulous <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmu/the-art-of-macro-photography/?utm_source=Art%20of%20Macro%20in%20CMblog%20sidebar&amp;utm_medium=Art%20of%20Macro%20in%20CMblog%20sidebar&amp;utm_campaign=Art%20of%20Macro%20in%20CMblog%20sidebar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alumni of my Art of Macro Photography workshop</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Keep your eyes open.</h2>
<p>My favorite tip may be the most obvious but it&#8217;s worth stating. When shooting macro, always keep your eyes open for new opportunities and subjects.</p>
<p>This is a time to really slow down and take in all the beauty in the tiny details around you. You may have an idea of what you want to capture when you set-out to shoot, but sometimes the most interesting and exciting photo opportunities come from the most spontaneous subjects!</p>
<p>If you are open-minded, keep observing, and stay curious, you will be amazed at what you may find.</p>

			<h2>2. Pay attention to your background.</h2>
<p>This could mean making sure you have a simple background without distractions or it could mean finding or creating a really interesting and beautiful background. The point is that it isn&#8217;t just your subject that makes the image work.</p>
<p>Take the time to decide if the background adds visual interest to your photograph or if it is distracting from your intended subject. Don&#8217;t be afraid to move things to new locations. The background can totally make or break your image!</p>

			<h2>3. Experiment with color.</h2>
<p>Utilizing color theory is one of the best ways to add interest to your macro images. Consider how the combinations of colors in your photograph will work together to create something beautiful and interesting.</p>
<p>I love to think about how my background color will look with my subject color. Complementary color and monochromatic color schemes are a couple of my favorite options for macro photography.</p>

			<h2>4. Shoot the unexpected.</h2>
<p>You will be amazed at how macro photography can make mundane objects, or even dead foliage, seem utterly exquisite. The joy of macro photography is that it gives us a glimpse of things that aren&#8217;t readily visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t limit yourself to obvious subjects like flowers. Sometimes the things that we might consider to be &#8220;ugly&#8221; are the subjects that are the most fascinating up close.</p>

			<h2>5. Change your perspective.</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t use a tripod for macro photography because I want to be able to move around and shoot from all different angles. Shoot from above, below and to the side of your subject. Observe how the light and background changes as you move around and see if you find something that works.</p>
<p>Try to think outside of the box and shoot from new perspectives and angles.</p>

			<p>I think we all have times when we are in a rut or feeling uninspired.</p>
<p>Sometimes we feel like we shoot the same thing in the same way, over and over.</p>
<p>We can not always feel excited by the things we are photographing, but sometimes we have to shoot anyway and push through it.</p>
<p>Winter is a wonderful time to practice macro photography since it can be easily done inside at any time of day. If you&#8217;re feeling bored with shooting macro, here are some of my favorite ways to add interest to my images, even for simple subjects that I&#8217;ve shot a million times before.</p>
<h2>1. Try reverse freelensing</h2>
<p>I have become obsessed with reverse freelensing. Freelensing is when you detach the lens from your camera and then ever so slightly tilt the lens to create blur similar to a tilt-shift and even let light leaks in the frame. Reversing the lens so that the front of it is facing your camera instead of your subject lets you achieve a closer focusing distance so you can shoot macro with a non-macro lens.</p>
<p>For me, reverse freelensing adds new interest to subjects I have shot before. I absolutely love the creative blur and gorgeous light leaks that can be achieved.</p>

			<h2>2. Try a Lensbaby lens</h2>
<p>Lensbaby lenses are great for adding a little creativity to any type of photography and they work for macro, too! I love my <a href="http://amzn.to/2kjPdmE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velvet 56</a> and, like with freelensing, the blur and bokeh is so unique that it creates interest in my images. With a magnification of 1:2, the Velvet 56 may not be a &#8220;true&#8221; macro lens to some but it lets you get pretty close &#8211; much closer than a non-macro lens.</p>
<p>If you have a Lensbaby Composer with optic(s) you can use the <a href="http://amzn.to/2kLbdHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lensbaby macro accessories</a> or regular extension tubes to create creative macro images. You can also try freelensing with a Lensbaby!</p>
<p>Lensbabies are manual focus lenses so you will need to take a little extra time with focus. Since macro subjects are typically still subjects, a great cheat to ensure focus is to use the liveview screen, zoom in on your subject, and then fine tune your focus.</p>

			<h2>3. Shoot through something</h2>
<p>This is another way to add visual interest to your image. You can try shooting through a copper pipe, bubble wrap, tulle, tissue paper, a prism… the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>To achieve this I typically cover one side of my lens (e.g., the left side) with the object I&#8217;m &#8220;shooting through&#8221; and then put the focal point of my subject on the other side, so that it gives the appearance that I am peeking through to see my subject.</p>

			<h2>4. Add some droplets!</h2>
<p>I LOVE spraying flowers, leaves, spiderwebs or pretty much anything with water to make it more interesting. Droplets can help you when you are struggling to find a focal point that looks intentional.</p>
<p>When I find myself in that predicament, I will spray with water and then look for a drop that is larger than the others, teetering on a petal edge, or unique in some other way. I then use that drop as my focal point for my image.</p>
<p>If water alone isn&#8217;t cutting it and you want even larger droplets, mix some organic dish soap or glycerin in with the water. Since glycerin makes the water particles stick together, the result is much larger drops. Next time you&#8217;re on Amazon, drop some <a href="http://amzn.to/2kL3OrB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glycerin in your shopping cart</a> and give it a try!</p>

			<h2>5. Freeze it!</h2>
<p>Freezing flowers is a lot of fun and you can get images that look like watercolor paintings.</p>
<p>I get a plastic container or bowl and put the flowers in the bottom and cover with water and place in my freezer. When the water is frozen like a giant ice cube and I&#8217;m ready to shoot, I take my bowl outside and carefully slide the frozen block of flowers out and shoot away. The layers of ice on top of the submerged flowers will give a beautiful and unique perspective on an ordinary flower.</p>

			<h2>6. Use dramatic light</h2>
<p>Try lighting your macro image differently than how you normally do.</p>
<p>If you usually use window light, try out a continuous artificial light like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2kMDBov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ice Light</a>. If you usually use flat light, try backlighting like you would in portraiture. Even direct, harsh light can be fun and create a unique look from the rest of your macro photography.</p>
<p>Lighting can change the appearance of your subject, so it can be really fun to experiment with various forms of lighting.</p>

			<h2>7. Intentionally shoot out of focus</h2>
<p>Out of focus photography can be tricky to master but can be so beautiful once you do. I love the look of the blur and bokeh from an OOF image and with macro you can achieve a gorgeous, painterly image.</p>
<p>The key here is to focus on shape and color when shooting intentionally OOF. A big blob of red isn&#8217;t interesting to look at but when you start to see shapes and swirls of color in an out of focus image, the interest increases. Use the colors and shapes to provide a way for the viewer&#8217;s eye to find their way through your image.</p>

			<p>Macro photography is a unique genre with its own learning curve.</p>
<p>Many people get frustrated when they first try to learn macro but the reality is that it takes practice and you just have to stick with it, like all types of photography. Let&#8217;s chat about some of the biggest mistakes you could make in your macro journey.</p>
<div style="display: none;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55733" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making.jpg" alt="5 macro photography mistakes you’re making" width="736" height="1444" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making.jpg 736w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making-214x420.jpg 214w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making-428x840.jpg 428w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making-200x392.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making-400x785.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-macro-photography-mistakes-you’re-making-600x1177.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></div>
<h2>1. Always using a tripod</h2>
<p>I never ever use a tripod for macro photography. I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t either, but you should at least TRY without the tripod. It&#8217;s incredibly freeing and allows you to be more creative and play with your angles. Don&#8217;t get bogged down by the idea that you need a tripod for macro work. Instead, try hand-holding and make sure your shutter speed is high enough to prevent motion blur. Many macro lenses, like the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/macro/ef-100mm-f-2-8l-macro-is-usm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon 100mm</a> or <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-vr-micro-nikkor-105mm-f%252f2.8g-if-ed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon 105mm</a>, are pretty heavy so I suggest staying at 1/200 of a second or faster.</p>

<h2>2. Never converting to black and white</h2>
<p>Many photographers shy away from black and white conversions for macro work, but the reality is that you can create gorgeous, stunning monochromatic macro images. For nature macro images, color is often the selling point of the subject, so it may be hard to strip that beautiful color. But, black and white can lend a timeless or moody feeling to your images. It&#8217;s a good technique to at least try! I find that my favorite black and white macro images have nice tonal variation between the subject and the background. I also look for strong light when thinking about which images to convert to black and white.</p>

<h2>3. Not adapting to the weather</h2>
<p>Harsh sun, wind, and rain can all put a damper on your macro session. When shooting macro outdoors, you have to either take the weather into consideration or move your subject and your shooting inside or under a covering. Wind is the biggest reason I will move inside &#8211; it is really tricky to work with and can ruin a macro session. If it&#8217;s just a light wind, you can try shielding the wind with your body to keep it off your subject. For full sun, you can certainly still shoot, just expose for your highlights. You can also try to block the direct sun with your body or a diffuser. Shooting in the rain can actually make for really unique and lovely images, but make sure to protect your gear!</p>

<h2>4. Using auto-focus</h2>
<p>I never rely on auto-focus for macro photography. It&#8217;s just not reliable enough when you are working with very narrow depth-of-field. Thus, I always stick with manual focus if possible!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-55388" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-840x561.jpg" alt="macro photo of water drops on a red flower by Tiffany Kelly" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-840x561.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-200x134.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/macro-photo-of-water-drops-on-a-red-flower-by-Tiffany-Kelly.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>5. Thinking you have to follow the rules</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to take risks! I realize I just gave you a bunch of rules and now I&#8217;m telling you to not follow rules, but bear with me. I think the biggest mistake we can make in any genre of photography is being afraid to try new things, to break the rules, to break out of the ruts we create for ourselves. I know I sometimes get stuck in a method of doing the same things the same way over and over. I have to break free from that to try new things.</p>
<p>Sometimes my experiment is a failure and I don&#8217;t get any images I love but more often than not, I get something new and creative that I really adore. I hope you feel the freedom that macro photography has to offer. When shooting nature, for example, you don&#8217;t need the compliance of your subject or anyone else. You can feel free to take your time and try all sorts of different things. Try shooting wide open and stopped-down, at all different angles, in full sun and shade. Experiment and have fun!</p>

			<p>The key to gorgeous black and white images often lies in the small details: making sure there is sufficient range of lights and darks, ensuring skin doesn&#8217;t look dull, and making sure our subject doesn&#8217;t fade into the background.</p>
<p>Paying attention to these details can help us ensure our image has the impact that we want. Believe it or not, color actually matters a lot in black and white conversions.</p>
<p>Here, I cover some little-known but simple Lightroom tricks that will help you polish and perfect your black and white conversions.</p>
<h2>1. White balance matters</h2>
<p>You may be really surprised to learn that your white balance matters even in black and white photos. That&#8217;s right, both your temperature and tint have an effect on how your black and white image will look. You can see it for yourself &#8211; open a black and white photo in Lightroom (or ACR in Photoshop) and grab your temperature slider. Slowly drag it all the way to the left, then all the way to the right. See how your image is affected? You can do the same exercise with the tint slider and watch your image change again.</p>
<p>In black and white images, various hues are assigned to a certain lightness or darkness. These values change as we adjust our white balance and the hues in the image change.  So, now that we know this super secret trick, you may be wondering if you should correct your white balance before converting your image to black and white? That sounds like a great idea to me. But another way to use this trick is to simply adjust your white balance AFTER you convert your image to black and white. This is what I do, and I simply adjust my white balance sliders until the image looks just right to my eye. Whether you adjust your white balance before or after converting to monochrome, one really important implication of this trick is CONSISTENCY. In other words, if you have a set of images and you want the black and white edits to look consistent, you will probably want to make sure they all have the same temperature and tint values. In this example below, the images are edited exactly the same except for the temperature.</p>

<h2>2. Temperature and tint can be adjusted locally as well</h2>
<p>Temperature and tint can be adjusted locally as well. It is important to remember that temperature and tint can be adjusted globally in Lightroom (and ACR) as described above but they can also be changed locally as well. You can do this by using any of local adjustments: the adjustment brush, radial filter, or graduated filter. This could be useful in situations when you want to brighten or darken certain hues in certain areas of your photo. You may be thinking you could just brighten the area with an exposure local adjustment, but this gives an entirely different effect. I prefer it because it is more subtle than using exposure adjustments. You should try it on your own images and play around to see for yourself! Here&#8217;s an example where I wanted to darken only the center of the daisy, so I applied a radial filter with temp -100 to only the center.</p>

<h2>3. The HSL panel becomes the black and white mix panel</h2>
<p>With this panel, we can selectively adjust certain hues in our image by altering how light or dark they are. For example, let&#8217;s say I want to darken the green grass in my image to make it closer to black. I can simply drag the green slider down to make it darker. Just remember it will affect ALL green in your image. If your skintones look muddy in your black and white conversion and you want to lighten them, try bumping up the orange slider just a little bit. I often use this panel to create subtle improvements in my portraits, such as darkening my background, darkening lips, or lightening skin or eyes. I also use this tip for macro images, as it enables me to very easily lighten and darken the only tones I want. In this example, the image on the top has the BW mix panel turned off and the image on the bottom I turned it back on. Since the rose was striped, I really wanted to increase the local contrast in the petals. I also wanted to brighten the background to make it white so it would be less distracting.</p>

<h2>4. Use the target with the black and white mix adjustments</h2>
<p>In the black and white mix panel, simply grab the little target icon. Then place on the area on your image that you want to adjust, click and then drag up (to brighten) or down (to darken) until you get it just right. In this example, I knew I wanted to create more contrast between the various areas of the peacock feather. Once I had converted the image to black and white though, I couldn&#8217;t even remember which areas of the feather were which color. A quick and easy way to adjust them to my liking was to just use the target icon on the various areas, and brighten and darken them to my liking. In this case, I brightened green, aqua, and blue, and darkened red and yellow. I paid close attention to her eyes and skin to make sure they still looked good after the adjustments.</p>

<p>I know it may seem counter-intuitive to think so much about color when creating black and white conversions, but the colors actually have a huge impact on how the black and white image will look.</p>

<p>I use the inverse square law to get nice, dark backgrounds. I love this type of background because it leads to simple images, it hides my messy house, and it helps my subject really pop against a dark background.</p>

<p>The inverse square law has to do with light fall-off. The farther you are from the light source, the more fall-off you will have. However, the exact amount of fall-off is not really intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>The quantity of light will be inversely proportional to its distance.</strong></p>
<p>According to the law, the power of the light will be inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, an object that is twice the distance from a source of  light will receive a quarter of the illumination (not half, as you might expect). Photographers who use artificial light need to understand this law to appropriately light their subjects. However, as natural light photographers we can use our knowledge of this law to perfect a technique for getting simple, dark backgrounds. We can utilize this law indoors, in our garage, and even outdoors.</p>
<p>If you want, you can ignore the boring math, but remember: the key to this technique is light fall-off. Light falls off increasingly over distance away from our light source.</p>

<p>Garage light is actually amazing for photos with black backgrounds. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; your garage does not need to be neat and tidy! You want to place your subject in the shade but close to the line from the sun. So look for the line on your garage floor of where the light and shadow meet. Place your subject right inside the shade. Try a chair if you have a subject that moves constantly like mine do! (Bonus tip &#8211; I actually used a tricycle for this image below and let her sit on it!)</p>

<p>By placing your subject this way, you get nice light on their face, but the light falls off quickly and becomes very dark behind your subject. If it&#8217;s overcast or the sun is behind your house, you can simply place your subject right at the edge of where your garage meets your driveway.</p>

<p>The inverse square law works indoors as well. Look for an area close to a bright light source, like a window, that has a darker background (no other lights or windows in the background). Hallways are one of my favorite places to look for light like this. In my house I have a couple hallways where I can close off doors to block light except for one window.</p>

<p>You want to get your subject in the light from your window and expose for their skin. That way, the light will fall off into darkness behind them.</p>

<p>You can even use the inverse square law outside. Look for a spot that is in the shade, and has a dark background. The edge of woods works perfectly for this. In my backyard I have an open area and then some trees. I can place my subject in the shade, near the open area, with the trees behind her. The dark trees give a shady background, but I still get nice light on her face since she is near and facing the open area.</p>

<p>A few other tips for perfecting the black background look: shoot pretty wide open (think in the f/1.4 &#8211; 2.5 range) and get pretty close to your subject. You want to create nice depth in your images to achieve this effect.</p>

<p>This type of photo often needs a little help in post processing to get a perfectly dark background. I use mostly Lightroom for my editing, so I will start by lowering shadows all the way down. Then, if I still have any spots, I try using an adjustment brush and bringing down shadows and/or blacks in any areas that need to be darkened. If the photo still needs more work, I will try an adjustment brush with lowered exposure, and that usually does the trick! The healing brush tool in Photoshop is also great for removing any random bright spots. Sometimes I don&#8217;t stress about getting the background completely black &#8211; especially if I have white doors in my background.</p>

<p>Next time you&#8217;re looking around your house for interesting light, keep the inverse square law in mind! It can help you transform a snapshot into a more artistic portrait. And remember, this technique can be applied easily in your messy garage or even outside as well!</p>

<p>Who is rejoicing with me?!</p>
<p>My daughter adores pre-school and I miss our little school-day routine. I&#8217;m so excited for her to get back to school with her friends and I can&#8217;t wait to see what she learns this year.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s chat about five easy and fun ways to document this joyous back-to-school time!</p>
<h2>1. Say it with chalk!</h2>
<p>I love using signs in milestone photos for things like the first day of school! You can either write on a chalkboard (chalk markers are so fun!) or be lazy like me and just write on the blank sign using the text tool in Photoshop. I think this will be so awesome to look back on this series of photos after a few years. If your little one decides to be silly with the sign like mine did, just roll with it and then have some fun in Photoshop later!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-47698" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-840x388.jpg" alt="first day of pre-k picture with chalkboard by Tiffany Kelly 2" width="840" height="388" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-840x388.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-420x194.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-330x152.jpg 330w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-690x319.jpg 690w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2-1050x485.jpg 1050w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first-day-of-pre-k-picture-with-chalkboard-by-Tiffany-Kelly-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>2. Capture new school details</h2>
<p>New shoes, new backpack, new lunchbox, new supplies? Capture it all! Just think of how these things will change over the years as your children grow and their tastes and favorite characters change. My daughter is in part-time pre-k so she doesn&#8217;t need a &#8220;real&#8221; backpack, but when she starts kindergarten I love the idea of taking a photo of her wearing her new backpack. I am sure she will look so tiny in comparison! Make sure you get in close and really capture the details of new shoes and fresh school supplies. And if your kiddo is like mine and loves her new lunchbox so much that she keeps hugging it, make sure you capture that too 🙂</p>

<h2>3. Document their handwriting</h2>
<p>This is another  thing what will change drastically in these early years. I love the idea of having your child write their name at the beginning of each school year. Even how they hold their crayon or pencil is a little detail that will certainly change from year to year.</p>

<h2>4. Capture back to school traditions</h2>
<p>Do you have any fun back to school traditions?  Maybe you have a special breakfast that morning or go out for milkshakes after school? These special traditions are certainly worth documenting! I haven&#8217;t yet decided what to do this year but you can bet I will take photos of it. If you have ideas for a fun back-to-school tradition please let me know in the comments!!</p>
<h2>5. Create a classic headshot</h2>
<p>I love the idea of taking a close-up, classic headshot every year as they start a new school year. Just think of how much they will change from year to year, and how incredible it will be to compare these portraits over the years. My daughter actually missed BOTH picture days at school last year, so this is my version of the DIY school portrait 🙂 Try to find a blank neutral backdrop for this photo &#8211; I simply used my wall in my dining room. I tend to like flat, non-dramatic light for these types of traditional photos, so I opened all the shades and let in the bright afternoon sun.</p>

<p>I think these images would make for an amazing album, along with photos of school celebrations and her artwork from the school year!</p>
