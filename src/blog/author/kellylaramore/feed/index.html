			<h2>Face the belly straight toward the camera</h2>
<p>We all know that sweet baby bump is going to be the star of the show in any maternity session. But we still want mom to look her best while capturing her belly from every angle.</p>
<p>Start by asking mom to stand with her weight on one leg and then bend her knee slightly. Then have her move the bent knee over in front of the other knee. This will create a natural curve in her body that is flattering and womanly.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>This is a great pose to start with because it is so versatile. It works against any backdrop and in any type of clothing. You can get three shots from this single pose: full body, three quarters (frame her from the knees up), and close up ( just the belly).</p>
<p><i>Pro tip: To prevent mom from looking wider than she really is, have her slightly lift her arms from her sides. This opens up the space between her arms and her waist to help define her shape rather than allowing her arms and torso to melt together.</i></p>

			<h2>Belly from the side</h2>
<p>Photographing that baby bump from the side allows you to really capture the perfect shape of mom’s transforming body.</p>
<p>To capture this, have mom turn sideways and bend the knee that is closest to the camera. Then have her place both hands under her belly to frame it. Then you could have her place the hand that is closest to the camera under the belly and the other hand on top of the belly. Finally, you can shoot this alone or have mom&#8217;s significant other stand behind her with arms wrapped around her.</p>
<p>These hand positions combined with the various compositions you can use in this pose allow you to get a lot of variety with minimal adjustments.</p>
<p><i>Pro tip: When asking mom to look at her belly, have her look slightly down on the ground about two feet in front her. This will elongate the neck and avoid a double chin. This is important to do when mom&#8217;s face is posed away from the camera because more of her neck is showing.</i></p>

			<h2>Backlit shot</h2>
<p>Light can make or break a shot. But in maternity photography, I find that the light can do more than simply dictate your camera settings. Instead, light can set the mood for the session.</p>
<p>My favorite light for maternity photos is backlight. The dreamy haze and bright, blown-out backgrounds of backlight match the hopefulness and joy of a maternity session.</p>
<p><strong>Clickin Moms member exclusive tutorial: <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/topic/405663-backlight-a-few-tips/?tab=comments#comment-5154368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tips for beautiful backlight</a></strong></p>
<p>To work with backlight, place mom in front of a large window and expose for mom&#8217;s skin. This will ensure that she is properly exposed while the window appears white behind her.</p>
<p>If you are outside, position mom with the sun behind her and expose for her skin. Based on your position and camera settings, you can get a rim of golden light around her, a haze of orange sunlight throughout the frame, or even a sunburst emerging from the background.</p>
<p>Avoid asking mom to look at the camera with her eyes open unless you have a reflector or a wall bouncing light back into moms eyes to see those catchlights.</p>
<p>Using diffuser fabric over the window will help create a softer, dreamy look.</p>

			<h2>Reclining shots</h2>
<p>Expecting moms work hard! It’s nice to let her put her feet up during a session and reclining shots add some beautiful variety to a final gallery.</p>
<p>Try having mom laying on one side and slightly bend her knees towards the camera. Ask her to place one hand on her belly.On a sofa, she can use the armrest to lean against and support herself. However, this pose can also be done on a bed or outside on the ground by using the other hand/arm to support her.</p>
<p>You can shoot this directly head on and at an angle from mom’s perspective to get variety from a singular pose.</p>

<p><i>Pro tip: Pay attention to which side of the face that moms hair is parted on. Have her sit so that the part side is the closest to the camera. This will help keep her hair from falling in front of her face.</i></p>

			<h2>The couple</h2>
<p>I always add mom’s partner into each pose and work hard to create a sense of connection with both mom and baby through my direction.</p>
<p>For example, when mom is sideways to the camera I will have dad face her or stand behind her and wrap his hands around her.</p>
<p>Another pose I will create with the two of them is the v-shape pose. I ask them to start off by facing each other belly to belly. Then I have them touch hips and shoulders that are farthest from the camera and open up the shoulders and hips that are closest to the camera. This creates a “v-shape.”</p>

			<h2>Use minor variations in each pose</h2>
<p>Many moms are feeling pretty uncomfortable by the time they have their maternity session. No one wants to do a lot of walking around when their ankles are swollen!</p>
<p>Using the same pose and same location with subtle changes will allow you to capture a full gallery without needing to wear mom out with wardrobe and location changes every five minutes.</p>
<p>Use the above 5 poses and then add these subtle changes to create a variety of looks for your clients:</p>
<h3>Direct mom’s eyes and hands</h3>
<p>With each pose, give directions to change things up by changing where mom looks and places her hands. Asking mom to look at the camera, then look at her belly, then close her eyes gives you three shots without her moving a muscle!</p>
<p>Then have her move both hands to the bottom of her belly, move one hand on top of the belly/one hand under the belly, look to the side, turn her chin to one side and have her sniff her shoulder (but keep that chin slightly pushed out). All of these tiny variations will create new photos with new emotions that will help you capture all of the love and excitement of expecting a baby.</p>
<h3>Have siblings and pets going the fun</h3>
<p>Just like it is a good idea to get mom’s partner in on action, be sure to get everyone in the family captured, too! Kids can hug the belly, kiss the belly, stand or sit next to mom and hug her arm. A toddler can sit on top of mom’s belly facing toward her.</p>
<p>And the furry family members count, too! Have mom bend down to kiss her pup or encourage the cat to come over to the sofa for a reclining shot. These are often the most unforgettable shots of the whole session!</p>
<h3>Add props or change outfits</h3>
<p>Simplicity is great in a maternity session, but if mom is game for changing outfits then by all means let her! It can be really fun to get her in a flowing gown and a pair of jeans to show more sides of her personality. Keep in mind that asking mom to change outfits too many times can wear her out. I recommend keeping it to 1-2 outfits.</p>
<p>If outfit changes seem too overwhelming, try adding easy props to the mix to add some variety. A blanket, floral crown, or even one of baby’s outfits can be sweet without distracting from mom or her bump.</p>

			<h2>Don’t be afraid to try something new</h2>
<p>Clients come to us because they love what they see in our portfolios. It&#8217;s important to give them some of what they&#8217;ve seen from us in the past. However, I always try think of one new pose to try out at the end of the session. I leave it for the end to make sure that I have created a good representation of my work for the client&#8217;s gallery.</p>
<p>Doing this will allow you to explore your creative side without running out of time to create a full gallery for your clients.</p>
<p>Next time you have a beautiful expectant mom in front of your camera, remember to keep it simple and maximize every pose. Having a plan will keep you from getting distracted or overwhelmed and will ensure that you and your clients get the results you want.</p>

			<p>So you bought those gorgeous presets that you’ve been eyeing all year long and now you can’t seem to figure out why your images still don’t look right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to walk you through five simple ways to tweak your presets to make them work for your images and give you the look you’ve been trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Lightroom presets are a great way to speed up your workflow and to get the look you want to achieve without spending a lot of time making adjustments. Many of us have all spent a lot of money over the years purchasing presets from our favorite photographers so that we can achieve the same look as them in our own images.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we tend to come across the same problem with almost every preset &#8211; one click of a preset just doesn’t get the job done.</p>
<p>Our images look nothing like the sample photos we drooled over before making our purchase.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I discovered what presets were and I was so excited until I edited that first image. I was devastated.</p>
<p>After all, I was just starting out in photography and it took me forever to save up the money to buy them. At the time, I didn’t have any income from photography and I certainly wasn’t going to get any income with images looking the way they did with those presets.</p>
<p>After a while, I realized that it takes some tweaking to get most presets to work for your images. Why? Your use of light, your camera settings and the type of camera you&#8217;re using will all make a difference in how the preset will affect your image.</p>
<p>Here are five simple ways to tweak your presets to make it work for you!</p>
<h2>1. Exposure</h2>
<p>Starting off with the correct exposure can make a big difference in how your preset will affect your image. It’s best to get the correct exposure in camera when shooting. However, you can adjust it in Lightroom if needed.</p>
<p>If your exposure is correct and your image still looks a bit off, sometimes even a little bump in exposure (0.1 to 0.3) or a slight decrease (-0.1 to -0.3) is all it takes for an image to look great with your chosen preset. In the sample below, I needed to increase exposure +0.7, which is more than usual, but it made a huge difference.</p>

			<h2>2. White balance</h2>
<p>Correct white balance is EVERYTHING!</p>
<p>Many presets have a ton of color adjustments made to them and to ensure that the skin tones are still looking great after you apply your preset you have to make sure your white balance is spot on. If your whites are white then the rest of your colors will be the same colors seen in the preset sample images.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/color-by-kelvin-a-better-approach-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelvin</a> when I’m shooting and do my best to get the white balance correct in-camera. Sometimes I’m in a hurry and it’s not perfect so I still need to adjust the white balance in Lightroom.</p>
<p>To do that, I use the white balance eye dropper located in the Basic panel. This allows you to set the new neutral in the image and the rest of the colors will adjust appropriately.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the dropper is all that is needed. If not, I make slight adjustments to the temperature or tint sliders as needed. If the overall image appears too cool, I adjust the temperature sliders to the right. Still see a green tint throughout an image? I move the tint slider toward the right to add magenta to balance out the green.</p>
<p>In the sample below all I needed to do was use the white balance dropper to get me closer to the look I wanted from my preset.</p>

			<h2>3. HSL Panel (Hue-Saturation-Luminance Panel)</h2>
<p>If you’ve checked your white balance and exposure and think your image still isn’t looking right, move on down to the HSL panel.</p>
<p>Sometimes a preset that was applied could simply be enhancing a color cast in your image. Or the preset could be changing the overall colors too much and simply need to be toned down a bit. To correct this, I use the HSL panel.</p>
<p>The HSL panel is a great option because it allows you to adjust each color individually as needed. In this image, the only changes I made were to the yellow saturation slider by decreasing it to -100. I then reduced the exposure slightly because removing the yellow made the image appear brighter.</p>

			<h3><u>HUE</u></h3>
<p>I tend to avoid making adjustments to the Hue sliders because doing so will change the shade of the color, taking you too far from the look of the preset.</p>
<h3><u>SATURATION</u></h3>
<p>The saturation sliders allow you to adjust the intensity of each color. Most of the time a simple desaturation of a specific color will make your image look better.</p>
<p>I tend to always decrease the yellow saturation slider for indoor images and decrease the green saturation slider for outdoor images. If you’re trying to figure out what color you will need to decrease, look for a color cast in your image then pull that color saturation slider down to fix it.</p>
<p>For example, I have terrible yellow-orange hardwood floors and when I’m shooting in my living room during the day the natural light from the windows reflects off the floors creating an orange color cast on my subject. The easiest way for me to fix the color cast from the floor is to pull down the orange or yellow saturation slider until I feel the skin tones look correct.</p>
<p>Another example would be if you&#8217;re shooting outside in the grass or in the woods, noticing a green color cast on your subject’s skin. Pulling the green saturation slider down just enough to take the color off their skin will make a huge difference.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/color-casts-avoid-remove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What are color casts and how to avoid them</a></strong></p>
<h3><u>LUMINANCE</u></h3>
<p>The Luminance panel will allow you to adjust how bright or dark a color is. I will only adjust this if I feel like a color is too distracting, decreasing the slider to make it darker and less noticeable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the best ways to avoid needing to make color adjustments in the HSL panel is to place your subject in good light and to avoid shooting in situations that reflect a color cast. For natural light photographers, sometimes that can be a bit more challenging. If we can avoid color casts, it will make your editing workflow much faster.</p>
<p>When I’m outdoors, I try to find a natural reflector to not only bounce good light in front of my subjects but to also deflect any color cast that might affect my subject’s skin tone. I use a neutral colored building, neutral colored concrete sidewalks, white gravel, etc.</p>
<p>If I’m indoors and plan to stand pretty close to my subjects while shooting, I wear a neutral colored shirt like white, gray, or black and avoid orange, yellow, or bright green colored clothing.</p>

			<h2>4. Tone curve</h2>
<p>The tone curve panel can appear a little overwhelming at first glance and most people tend to skip right past it. If you’re using a preset and you like the image how it is after making the previous adjustments we talked about, you can certainly skip making adjustments here.</p>
<p>I like to use the tone curve to help my images pop and stand out more. You can either move each of the sliders in the tone curve panel until you have the look you want or you can use the “s curve” technique to make quick adjustments.</p>

			<h2>5. Detail Panel</h2>
<p>Sometimes after applying a preset, I notice that my image seems softer than I like it to look. If so, I go to the detail panel and increase the sharpening amount.</p>
<p>After I have the sharpening amount where I like it, I will hold down the ATL or OPTION key and click on the masking slider until I see an overlay. The white of the image is showing where the sharpening is being applied. I will then move the masking slider to the right, just until the subject’s skin shows solid black. Doing so removes the sharpening from the areas in black which allows your subjects skin to still appear smooth and the bokeh to still appear creamy.</p>

			<p>These simple steps will help guide you as to where to go to make adjustments to your new presets to make them work for your images.</p>
<p>Each session will most likely need a whole new set of tweaks so you&#8217;ll likely find that the changes you’ve made on one session may not be the same changes you need for your next session. But once you know where to look to make those adjustments, your editing workflow will be much quicker and you will fall in love with your new preset collection all over again!</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re interested, my favorite presets to use are <a href="https://www.mastinlabs.com/products/mastin-labs-fuji-pro-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastin Labs Fuji Pro Pack</a> for outdoor photos and VSCO Film 05 for indoor photos!</p>
