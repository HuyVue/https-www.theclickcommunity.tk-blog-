			<p>I always had an interest in photography. I remember borrowing my dad’s camera from time to time as a teen. Rolls of film would be used to capture landscapes and my own family whenever I could get my hands on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All I knew back then was to simply click the shutter and hope that I got something good. Then school, college, and grad school happened. And all that photography passion went to the sidelines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>A rough start</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2012, about six months after my son was born, when I bought my first DSLR camera. It was a Canon T3 Rebel. I was so proud of taking that first step of owning something that was mine.</p>
<p>At that time, all I could think to myself was, “I have a fancy DSLR now and I spent good money on it. I should be able to take great photos!” I had no idea how much learning and practice was required to actually implement and start taking semi decent photographs of my family!</p>
<p>My DSLR was there as I took many photos of my little boy as he grew. But those pictures were mostly snapshots (and a bit cringe-worthy when I look back at them now!)</p>
<p>Even though I had the best intentions to learn it all, I had no idea what I was doing. I watched many YouTube videos trying to self learn while juggling a full time job and a newborn. I found myself perpetually frustrated. The thought that I would never be good enough to do this started to creep in.</p>
<p>As a last feeble attempt, I enrolled myself in an in-person camera class. However, even that truly never worked out and I ended up more confused than before.</p>
<p>Everything seemed like ‘rocket science’ to me. Why was it so hard to understand exposure? Why were all my shots blurry? Nothing made sense! I had no friends who shared my interest in photography during those years and no mentor to ask all of the questions I had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so my DSLR just stayed in my closet collecting dust.</p>

			<h2>Education made fun</h2>
<p>In 2015, we were planning on going on a big dream vacation to Europe. I so wanted to use my big camera during our trip to document our travels. Inspired to try again to learn how to use my camera, I turned to Google. And that’s when I found <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a>.</p>
<p>The photos were beautiful and everything about it seemed so friendly and encouraging. And I could relate to this group of moms who wanted to take better photos! I decided to enroll myself then and there to learn as much as I could.</p>
<p>When I logged into the forum for the first time, I was in awe of (and a little overwhelmed by) all the information I found. Whether I wanted to learn about light or figure out why I couldn’t get things in focus, it was all right there waiting for me. The biggest challenge was finding time to read it all!</p>
<p>Even more, I found that these tutorials weren’t technical and boring. They were so friendly and fun that I looked forward to reading as many as I could I had finally found the place where I could learn how to use my camera.</p>

			<h2>Inspiration through the work of others</h2>
<p>As a mom who was mainly interested in taking photos of her child, I could not get enough of the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/18-picture-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picture share forum</a> when I first joined Clickin Moms. There was so much inspiration from other photographers and I loved to share my favorite shots alongside all of the talented artists there.</p>
<p>I would be nervous posting my images anywhere else. I was afraid of the criticism and unkind comments that can be so freely given on social media and other forums. But I knew that at Clickin Moms, the feedback would always be encouraging and helpful.</p>
<p>This kind of sharing allowed me to grow. It helped me build confidence so that I could move from okay photos to pictures of which I was truly proud. With the examples of the amazing artists at Clickin Moms, I was inspired to be the best photographer I could be.</p>

			<h2>Putting myself out there for critique</h2>
<p>Opening your work up to critique can be scary. Especially when it’s a picture of your child that you love. But at Clickin Moms, I learned to love critique as I found that it was truly the best way to learn and grow.</p>
<p>There were times when I would find myself knowing that a photo could use a little something extra. But I couldn’t put my finger on what that something extra was. That’s when I would post my work in the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/2-serious-critique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious critique forum</a>.</p>
<p>The Click Pro community and the Clickin Moms Mentors were always around to offer support and feedback on whatever I needed. The feedback was about growth and positivity rather than bringing me down.</p>
<p>Just like the kind comments in the picture shares, these more detailed critiques left me feeling like I could improve. The professionals and experienced artists at Clickin Moms made me feel like I <i>could</i> improve! They told me what I was doing right and gave me real steps to figure out how to get better. And that made all the difference in my photography journey.</p>

			<h2>Advice on business<i> </i></h2>
<p>While I bought my camera with the intention of starting a new hobby, it didn’t take long before I started to think about how this could be a business. However, there’s a lot more to starting a photography business than just taking good pictures! Clickin Moms was there to help when I was ready to take the leap from hobbyist to professional.</p>
<p>With a community made of people at all different places in their photography journeys, I was able to have input from people who had been in my shoes. I was able to learn from photographers who knew what it took to be in business and could guide me as I planned for my own.</p>
<p>This community allowed me to start my business with confidence and avoid so many of the pitfalls many photographers face as they make the move to becoming professionals.</p>

			<h2>Diversity in genres</h2>
<p>It’s true that many of the photographers who are at Clickin Moms started with photography just like I did. They bought a “fancy camera” because they wanted to take photos of their kids.</p>
<p>But there are so many other kinds of photographers at Clickin Moms, too! Whether you want to try landscapes or still life, portraits or weddings, macro or fine art, there are other photographers who are working in those genres, too, at Clickin Moms.</p>
<p>Even though I still love photographing my kids the most, this diversity has inspired me to try new things and find other genres that I enjoy. This experimenting keeps me inspired I love to see what new subjects the artists at Clickin Moms are photographing.</p>

			<h2>Real life friendships</h2>
<p>If someone told me ten years ago that real friends can be found online too, I would have laughed out loud. Yet, that’s exactly what happened!</p>
<p>Connected by our shared love of photography, it’s easy to create true friendships here. More than a few times you will see people from this virtual community traveling to meet-up or organizing get-togethers with their local members.</p>
<p>Some of the friends I have made through this community are now my lifelong friends. Our relationships extend beyond photography as we share stories of motherhood and work and life. Even our kids have become friends! How awesome is that?!</p>

			<h2>Setting goals</h2>
<p>Being a member of Clickin Moms really opened my eyes to the possibilities of what I could do with my camera. I realized that while taking better pictures of my kids was a great goal, the sky is the limit when it comes to what I can do with my camera.</p>
<p>Whatever your goals are, Clickin Moms is the place where you can set them, work toward them, and reach them with a group of artists who wants you to succeed.</p>
<p>I am honestly thankful for all my achievements and blessings that came along my way in this photography journey. To me, it’s not really just about photography anymore. It’s about something much bigger.</p>
<p>Photography is about the connections and the sense of community between women photographers all around the world. We lift one another up and encourage each other to be our best. It has changed my life for the better and I owe all of it to <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a>.</p>

			<p>When my first child was born, I got myself a fancy new DSLR camera. I knew that I wanted as many photos of him as possible and that those photos should be beautiful. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In his early years, my camera was aimed at him nonstop! I worked hard to capture him playing and doing all the sweet things that I wanted to remember.</p>
<p>After a while though, I realized something was missing: ME.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Where was I? I surely existed through the diaper changes, the cuddles, the giggles and all those goofy faces we made together. But I was nowhere to be found in the tangible memories that I worked so hard to create. Even in my cell phone I would find ways to hide in the photos behind my son.</p>
<p>And I found that as time went by, it was quite difficult to remember all the details of being a mother.</p>
<p>Yes, we can all list a million reasons why we don’t want to be in photos. But just like we work so hard to document our kids, we should work to document ourselves with our children. Because mama, you are a big part of their childhood!</p>

			<h2>Have the right gear</h2>
<p>Sure, you can just hold your cell phone at arm’s length and get in the picture with your kids. But when you want to create more intentional self portraits, having the right gear can make all the difference.</p>
<p>A tripod really helps to keep your camera be stable, avoiding any shake. as you release the shutter. A flat surface works in a pinch, but a tripod will likely be safer and easier to maneuver.</p>
<p>A remote is incredibly helpful when taking self portraits as well. Instead of hitting the shutter button on-camera and running back and forth to beat the timer, you can simply hold the remote in your hand and snap away while away from the camera.</p>

			<h2>Get your settings right</h2>
<p>There are few things worse than working hard to set-up a self portrait with your kids, having a super sweet moment that you <i>know</i> looks adorable, and then finding that it is underexposed or out of focus. Argh!</p>
<p>So before you start snapping away, use these guidelines to ensure that your settings will be just right:</p>
<h3>Shutter speed</h3>
<p>Keep your shutter speed nice and fast. I don’t go below 1/250 because when I am in the frame with my toddler, you can bet she’s going to move!</p>
<h3>Aperture</h3>
<p>While you might be able to shoot wide open when you are behind the camera, it is always best to close down a bit when shooting self portraits with kids. There is a good chance that you and your children will move when in front of the camera. Having a larger depth of field ensures that you will still be in focus even if you aren’t in the same exact spot you were in when you started shooting.</p>
<p>My widest f-stop when shooting self portraits is f/4. I love shooting wide open but for self portraits, it’s more important to have us captured clearly. You can’t fix a blurry image later in post!</p>

			<h2>Be mindful of your composition and background</h2>
<p>Once you got your settings right, you want to make sure you have a clean background. There are times when clutter in the background can tell a story (especially the clutter of kids!). However, unintentional elements in the background can be really distracting and take away the focus from the subject: you and your kids.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Set-up your self portrait in a place where the background works to keep you and your kids as the center of attention. A blank wall is perfect, or you can pose close to a window and let the background fade to darkness (courtesy of the <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/inverse-square-law-creating-clean-portraits-physics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse Square Law</a>).</p>
<p>When you have your background just as you want it, then you can position yourselves in the frame to create a strong composition. I recommend shooting a bit wider than you normally would. This allows you to crop in post processing to get the composition just as you want it without fear of losing any important details at the edges of the frame.</p>

			<h2>Capture the emotion</h2>
<p>Being a mother is full of emotion. While formal portraits are beautiful, I like to focus on connections.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a self portrait with one kid or all of your kids, get them as close to you as possible. Hugs, cuddles, tickle fights, silly jokes to get all of them laughing, all of them work great for establishing connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/topic/408353-self-portrait-tutorial-4-ways-to-convey-a-mood-with-your-image/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=cmblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Want more? Check out this MEMBER EXCLUSIVE tutorial on the Clickin Moms forum on how to create mood in your self portraits!</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Another way to really capture connection is to share eye contact with your kids. It is our instinct to look at the camera for a photo, but shared gazes show that you are so wrapped-up in each other that the camera doesn’t even matter.</p>
<p>Remember, connection is all about making the viewer FEEL something from your storytelling. Identify your audience and then figure out how to best speak to them.</p>

			<h2>Document the daily grind</h2>
<p>It’s nice to get dressed beautifully, put some makeup on and turn the camera toward yourself when you look your best. But that’s not always possible! And I think that there is something beautiful about capturing the reality of the everyday.</p>
<p>Keep a journal the things that fill your routines with the kids. Packing their lunches, combing hair, cleaning and organizing. These things may seem like mundane tasks but they are the kinds of things that you won’t be doing in a few years. Identify these parts of your day and then document them.</p>
<p>I would urge you to consider doing a “day in the life” shooting project. Set up your camera in a central spot and shoot in a continuous mode. Capture the day as it unfolds from this one perspective and marvel at how much goes on in a single day with you and your kids!</p>
<p>I promise that when you look back at them years from now, when the kids are all grown up, these are the pictures that will warm your heart and remind you that time really is so precious!</p>

			<h2>Get creative</h2>
<p>Once you get comfortable with the idea of being in the photos, feel free to get a little creative! Try changing your shooting angle for a new point of view. Experiment with different lenses and focal lengths. Use objects around the house to shoot through to change-up your composition and add textures. Work with slow shutter speeds to get the blur of your kids running around while you stand in one spot.</p>
<p>Allowing yourself to explore self portraiture with a bit of creativity can make the discomfort of being in front of the camera melt away. Instead, you are focused on mastering a technique while still capturing the moments that matter with your kids.</p>

			<h2>Let loose and have FUN!</h2>
<p>This is by far the most important tip for capturing self portraits with your children. Because this venture can totally be stressful if we are too serious about it!</p>
<p>Instead, I urge you to look at this as another way to enjoy your kids. Instead of dwelling upon the final images, focus on the experience you are having with your kids.</p>
<p>If you are shouting at them and sweating with frustration, no one is going to be particularly thrilled with the undertaking. But if you are silly and happy and offer a chocolate at the end (because bribery totally works!)? You and your kids will look back at these photos with fond memories to go with the beautiful pictures.</p>
<p>This Mother’s Day, I want you to remember that your kids adore you. They don’t remember that you are having a bad hair day or that you are tired. They remember the mom who stays up to rock them sleep. The mom who makes their favorite cake every birthday. The mom who kisses boo boos and wipes away tears.</p>
<p>They want you to get in the photo. Perhaps they don’t know it now, but I promise they do. So dust off your tripod and bring out your favorite lens get excited to photograph yourself in the frame with your kids! You will be giving yourself the best Mother’s Day gift you could ever receive.</p>

			<p>I remember three years ago when I first had the confidence to switch my camera from Auto mode to manual. I was <i>terrified</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What if I missed my shot?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What if I couldn’t change my settings as fast as my kids could run away from me?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And I still had that little doubt inside of me asking if there really would be a positive difference in my photos when I shot manual mode versus Auto. I knew that everyone told me I needed to make the switch…but my camera seemed pretty smart!</p>
<p>If you are feeling the same fear and apprehension I felt when I made the switch, I am here to help! Maybe you are just getting started with your camera or perhaps you are someone who is pretty confident shooting in other ‘Auto modes.’ But if you aren’t using your camera in manual mode, you likely aren’t taking advantage of all your camera has to offer.</p>
<p>Let’s explore what it means to shoot in manual mode and how it can make your photos better together.</p>

			<h2>The Auto Modes</h2>
<p>First, let’s define what the various Auto modes are on your camera and what they do.</p>
<h3>Auto mode</h3>
<p>In full Auto mode, your camera is “looking” at any scene and choosing the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to get the best exposure. And your camera? It’s pretty smart! It will often get your exposure just right and allow you to snap away with photos that aren’t too dark or too bright.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>But your camera is a tool, not an artist. When you shoot in Auto mode, it won’t know whether or not you want a blurry background. Your camera won’t know that you want to expose for that tiny area of bright light rather than balancing the exposure of the whole frame. So while your camera in Auto mode is smart, it is not able to make artistic decisions.</p>

			<h3>Aperture Priority mode</h3>
<p>It is usually the A or the Av mode in your camera. In this mode, the photographer sets the aperture (f-stop) and the camera automatically selects the shutter speed and ISO to get proper exposure in any given situation.</p>
<p>This mode allows you to fully control the depth of field of your shot. However, you are trusting your camera to know what shutter speed is fast enough to freeze the motion of any given subject. You are also risking having more noise than you may want in lower light situations.</p>

			<h3>Shutter Priority mode</h3>
<p>This is usually the the symbol Tv or S on your camera. In this mode, the photographer sets the shutter speed. The camera sets chooses the aperture (f-stop) and ISO that allows you to capture proper exposure with any given shutter speed.</p>
<p>If your priority is to freeze motion or capture motion blur, this is a great option! However, you might find that your camera chooses an aperture with a depth fo field that is too narrow. Your fast-moving subjects may end-up blurry not from motion blur but because they are out of the plane of focus.</p>

			<h2>What is Manual mode?</h2>
<p>Manual mode is typically indicated by the symbol M in your camera. In this mode, the photographer chooses the aperture (f-stop), the shutter speed, and the ISO.</p>
<p>The photographer makes the decision on exposing the image correctly by controlling all three elements of the exposure triangle. The camera does not choose any of these settings and the photographer must dial all three in individually in any given situation.</p>
<p><i>Note that shooting in manual mode is not the same as shooting in manual focus. Shooting with a manual focus means that the photographer moves the focus ring on the lens and turns it until the desired elements are in focus. Autofocus allows the camera to move the focus ring until the area selected in the viewfinder is in focus. This is a separate concept from Manual mode.</i></p>
<p>Shooting in manual mode is widely seen as the most important step in advancing yourself as a photographer and artist. Manual mode allows you to control the exposure of your shot exactly as it matches your vision.</p>

			<h2>Exposure</h2>
<p>The relationship between these three settings is called the <i>exposure triangle</i>. Having proper exposure means that you have details visible in the shadows and highlights of the most important areas of your photographs.</p>
<p>These settings affect the amount of light entering the camera as they affect how wide the lens elements open (aperture), how fast the shutter opens and closes (shutter speed), and the sensitivity of the camera sensor (ISO). As aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, each change individually, you will need to adjust the other two settings to compensate.</p>

			<h2>Aperture</h2>
<p>Aperture controls the amount of light that enters the camera by controlling the size of the aperture ring. It also controls the depth of field in any given photograph.</p>
<p>When the aperture is larger (which means that the f-stop number is smaller), more light will be let into the camera and the depth of field will be smaller. This means that a smaller area away from the camera will be in acceptable focus as you choose your focal point.</p>
<p>If you like blurry backgrounds(often desired in portrait photography), you will want a larger aperture. If you are trying to get more of the frame in focus (often desired in landscape photography) you will want a smaller aperture.</p>
<p>As you choose your aperture, you will need to adjust your shutter speed and ISO to let the proper amount of light into the camera so that your exposure is correct.</p>

			<h2>Shutter speed</h2>
<p>Shutter speed helps freeze motion or create blur in a given shot. A slow shutter speed will capture the blur of the movement and a high shutter speed will freeze the motion.</p>
<p>Shutter speed also affects the amount of light that is let into the frame. The faster the shutter speed the less light is allowed into the frame. The slower the shutter speed, the more light that is allowed into the frame.</p>
<p>As a photographer, it is really important to understand the importance of using the right shutter speed. Blurry shots as a result of slow shutter speed cannot be fixed with Photoshop magic! You will want to choose a shutter speed that will allow you to control the blur while using all three exposure variables to ensure that there is enough light entering the camera.</p>

			<h2>ISO</h2>
<p>ISO controls how much light enters the camera by making the sensor more or less sensitive to light. With film photography, the ISO was determined by the film stock. In digital photography, we choose the ISO in our camera settings.</p>
<p>In general, you will need a higher ISO when there is less light available. You will need a higher ISO when more light is available.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that ISO also brings in additional grain to the final image when increased to a somewhat higher number. This higher number is usually dependent on your camera’s make and model and it’s ability to handle light/grain in low light situations.</p>

			<h2>Make the move to “M”</h2>
<p>I know. All these settings can be <i>really</i> daunting at first. But I promise you that it all comes together with practice.</p>
<p>Try experimenting with your camera. Change one setting while keeping the other settings constant and see the effect on your images. This is a great exercise to see how each setting affects what the camera sees!</p>
<p>Then, try getting the same exposure while adjusting all three settings in tandem. See how you can control the light in the frame while changing aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.</p>
<p>As you continue to control each of these variables, you will not only be better able to control the light and technical success of your photos. You will also be able to control how you use those settings creatively. You will be allowed to use your camera as the tool to create art. And from there the possibilities are endless.</p>

			<p>The first DSLR camera I owned was the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-rebel-t3-ef-s-18-55-is-ii-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon Rebel T3</a> with the kit lens that came with the camera, a 18-55 zoom lens.</p>
<p>I used my camera in auto mode back then and really didn’t want anything more than that for my photography needs at that time.</p>
<p>When I started getting little more serious about my photography journey about two years ago, I started to feel the limitations of my set-up and I knew it was time to change things up a bit.</p>
<p>The Nifty Fifty (aka <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/ef-50mm-f-18-stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50mm f/1.8 prime lens</a>) was my first prime lens purchase and was an obvious choice for me at that point because it is fairly inexpensive, incredibly versatile, and allowed me to get the kinds of images I loved seeing from other photographers whose work I admired.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, I have three primes lenses and one zoom lens. I find myself reaching for both my primes and my zoom lens depending on what and where I am photographing. Each has a place in my shooting style and each plays a special role in how I capture the world around me.</p>
<p>Here are a few pros and cons of zooms versus prime lenses and why you may choose one over the other.</p>
<h2>Zoom lenses (anything with a range in focal lengths)</h2>
<p>Apart from my kit lens that came with the camera, the first zoom lens I had was a used <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/telephoto-zoom/ef-75-300mm-f-4-5-6-iii-usm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon 75-300mm</a> which allowed me to have a range from a standard portrait focal length to a focal length that allowed me to capture action from very far away. Next I invested in a <a href="https://amzn.to/2EGEqsD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 12-24 wide angle zoom lens</a> which I found to be a perfect fit for travel, work and family vacations.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of a zoom lens is that it has varying focal lengths. It helps you to ‘not move around as much’ when you cannot or don’t want to. It&#8217;s especially helpful when photographing landscapes, sports, action, wildlife, street and sometimes even kids where you don&#8217;t have to be close to them to get your shot.</p>
<p>With varying focal lengths you also get versatility. This means being able to use one lens at different focal lengths for the price of one! For example, the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/standard-zoom/ef-24-70mm-f-2-8l-ii-usm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon 24-70mm</a> has the most common lengths of 35mm and 50mm built in. This means you don&#8217;t have to carry various prime lenses while being out and about or swap lenses mid-session and can still shoot at various focal lengths.</p>
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of a zoom lens is its lack of ‘sharpness’ and superior image quality. Since the lens ‘caters’ to multiple focal lengths there are more elements within the lens to give the user that flexibility and this can sacrifice the image quality that prime lens shooters love so much.</p>

			<h2>Prime lenses (fixed focal length)</h2>
<p>I own the 35mm, 50mm, 85mm and 105mm prime lenses. With a prime lens the focal length is fixed, meaning you cannot adjust the ‘ring in front of your lens’ to zoom in or out. In other words, you must physically move around more to zoom closer to or further from your subject!</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a prime lens is its sharpness. There are fewer elements inside a prime lens since there&#8217;s only one focal length, hence a generally higher image quality and more consistent sharpness in the images.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of prime lenses is wider apertures like f/1.8, f/1.4 and f/1.2. This means better potential performance in low light conditions as well as <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/beautiful-bokeh-photography-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better bokeh</a> which is often desirable in portraits.</p>
<p>One of the main disadvantages of a prime lens is the fact that you don&#8217;t have the flexibility of that ‘zoom’ when you physically cannot move closer to the subject.</p>

			<h2>So which type of lens is better overall?</h2>
<p>That depends on where you are as a photographer and what you need!</p>
<p>If you intend to capture daily life and need to be able to get super close and move far away at lightning speed, a zoom might be the lens you need.</p>
<p>If you value tack sharp focus above all else, a prime lens might serve you best.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t ready to invest in a bunch of lenses and get flexibility and portability at the same time for more value for your buck, a zoom lens could be the one for you.</p>
<p>If you desire higher image quality, capability to function in low light situations, or that dreamy bokeh in your portrait work I would look into owning a prime lens.</p>
<p>The key is, identify your style and needs as a photographer and choose the gear that will best help you create the kind of work you love. There is no right choice for everyone, just the right choice for you!</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s something we hear all the time but can&#8217;t be emphasized enough &#8211; light is everything.</p>
<p>Good lighting not only illuminates the subject in the image but also draws our eye to where we want the viewer to focus.</p>
<p>Learning how to use this light and controlling or manipulating it is crucial for an image to stand out as unique. Of course, composition and other technical details are important, too, but light is key.</p>

			<p>Beautiful light is all around us. However, to see this and create dramatic images requires some patience and observation.</p>
<h2>1. Be observant. Be patient.</h2>
<p>Once we learn to slow down a little and start observing, we begin to appreciate the beauty surrounding us.</p>
<p>As a mother, I love photographing my children the most. However, I&#8217;ve learned that having a subject matter just for myself to feed my soul and inspire me is also important.</p>
<p>Taking a break from my usual subjects, I often wonder in my own backyard in the hope of finding things to photograph. When I&#8217;m out walking in my yard or out for a stroll, I&#8217;m always observing light and how it falls on the objects surrounding me &#8211; the ground and trees &#8211; as well as how it casts shadows and create light patterns.</p>
<p>Being an observant photographer is the first step in learning to manipulate and control light to create drama.</p>

			<p>Once you begin studying and really observing light, you will begin to form a vision of how you want even a simple subject like a flower to appear in your final product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want the image to be bold and moody? Consider underexposing to allow the light to stand out in contrast.</li>
<li>Do you want the image to be backlit? <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/easy-backlighting-tips-for-your-photography-by-michael-kormos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Backlight</a> adds a soft and gentle element to any image.</li>
<li>Or maybe you want to use side light and find a unique angle? This adds additional elements to create intrigue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a vision in mind as to how you want your final image to look is important.</p>
<h2>3. Add contrast and mood with light and shadows.</h2>
<p>For most of my macro and still life images, I like to underexpose them a tad to bring out contrast. This adds depth and mood to the image.</p>

			<h2>4. Explore various lighting scenarios.</h2>
<h3>Outdoor backlight:</h3>
<p>I use the <a href="http://amzn.to/2xR0tyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 105 mm f/2.8 macro lens</a> for most of my outdoor still life and macro images. With this lens, I can go to f/2.8 which is a good aperture to capture everyday life and macro if you want bokeh in the background.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t always shoot wide open with that lens, it is definitely helpful to have that capability. While a lower f-stop will bring in some haze in the image, you can also achieve this with a smaller f-stop depending on how you angle your camera towards the subject.</p>
<p>You can also deliberately increase the f-stop to capture some magical flares while still focusing on the subject with your macro lens. If needed, I&#8217;ll tilt my camera towards the light to let a slight amount of light in the frame.</p>
<p>By doing this while the sun rays are peeking through a tiny slim fence partition in your yard (this is just one example) creates that perfect flare while backlighting your image.</p>

			<h3>Outdoor rim light:</h3>
<p>For macro photography, I like to achieve a subtle rim lighting effect without losing the details in the image. Rim light is when your subject is beautifully highlighted by a strip of light. With this type of lighting, it&#8217;s important to retain the details of your subject.</p>

			<h3>Indoor side light:</h3>
<p>When indoors, use natural window light to illuminate the subject. Using side light from a window is my favorite type of lighting when indoors.</p>
<p>With light and shadows in the frame, it creates a perception of depth and adds to the mood. Keep in mind that the closer your subject is to the window, the more contrast there will be between the light and shadows.</p>
