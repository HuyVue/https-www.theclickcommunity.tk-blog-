			<p>Photography has always been a passion of mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When I was younger, I took photography classes at the local recreation center with my dad. Every weekend we’d check out photography books from the library and pore over them together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I have always had a camera in my hand. I have strived to be the memory keeper of the family, making photo books of every vacation and trying to capture all of the important moments.</p>
<p>But as an adult, it never even occurred to me that I could pursue photography as not just a hobby but also as a career. All I knew of professional photographers were people who had gone to art school to study fashion photography. “Professional” in my mind meant elaborate studio setups and modeled shoots for magazines.</p>
<p>I figured that since I did not have a degree in photography that being a professional was out of reach. I was a full-time mom with 3 kids in tow and going back to school full time wasn’t an option.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And then a simple Google search led me to Clickin Moms. And suddenly, a whole new world opened up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In just four years, Clickin Moms has redefined for me what it means to be a photographer. These are the ways that this community has been instrumental in my own photography journey and how I see it impacting the lives of members from around the world.</p>

			<h2>A community of women</h2>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Clickin Moms is that it is a community of women. When I was hunting around for photography resources and materials, it seemed that almost everything I came across was incredibly male-dominated. Written by men, moderated by men, and from a male perspective.</p>
<p>Now, as a mother of a bunch of males, I take no issues with that perspective. But I craved resources that were created by someone with <i>me</i> in mind. From <i>my</i> point of view (or something similar). Moderated by people who understood me.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Clickin Moms was a breath of fresh air from the first time I set virtual foot in the forum. It felt like home. It was a place that I could express myself without fear of judgement or rejection. There was comfort in a place where I knew fellow members would just get what I was saying.</p>
<p>Many of the women on the forum come from a background similar to mine. Many are mothers, and most did not go to art school or even realize that they wanted to pursue photography until well into adulthood.</p>
<p>Because we have that common ground, it is easy for us to connect with one another, to create learning resources that make sense for us, and to lift each other up.</p>

			<h2>A community of encouragers</h2>
<p>I vividly remember the very first time I posted a picture to the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/18-picture-share/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picture Share forum</a> on Clickin Moms. And I was scared out of my mind! I had seen some of the amazing work that other women on the forum created and I thought to myself, “I will never measure up to that.”</p>
<p>And you know what? Not one person ever once made me feel as if that were the case. Right away I had people reaching out to me. They commented on my picture, asked me questions about myself, and were just generally encouraging.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/16-introduce-yourself/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Are you a new Clickin Moms member? YAY! We can&#8217;t wait to say hello to you on the forum!</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Because of that experience, I felt like I could reach greater heights. I was emboldened to achieve more than I previously thought I would be able to. I felt comfortable enough to spread my wings, to try out different things, and to find my voice. It is 100% because of the encouraging spirit of Clickin Moms that I am the photographer that I am today.</p>
<p>The sense of competition that I had experienced from other photography groups isn’t what Clickin Moms is about. The idea that knowledge is a secret not meant to be shared isn’t the way this community operates.</p>
<p>Instead, Clickin Moms fosters a sense of positivity that runs through everything from serious image critiques to just shooting the breeze with each other about parenting and makeup and life. The forum is always a safe place to land for everyone, from seasoned pros to brand new photographers.</p>

			<h2>A community of teachers</h2>
<p>If you want to learn from some of the absolute best photographers in the industry, then join Clickin Moms. I am constantly amazed by the sheer talent that is represented on the forum.</p>
<p>Seemingly every genre is represented! From food photographers to landscape artists to documentary family photographers, so many gifted and experienced women are willing to share their knowledge in the interest of paying it forward.</p>
<p>And everyone on the forum has something to teach the other members. Think about that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Every</i> person has something to teach the others. Not just the pros. Not just the mentors. Every member has something unique to teach the rest of the community.</p>
<p>This makes it so that all members feel empowered to share often. The number of tutorials, videos, and critiques is absolutely mind-boggling. The Clickin Moms forum is a veritable treasure trove of photographic knowledge!</p>
<p>When I first became a member, I scoured the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/23-learning-library-tutorials-and-articles/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial section</a>. I think I watched every single video in the library (and there are a lot!), read every article about lighting, composition, and editing, and downloaded every freebie that was offered.</p>
<p>I could not believe that all of this information was available to every member! All I had to do was log in and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>And if I have questions like “How can I set up back-button focusing on my new camera?” or, “How can I look cute and still be comfortable when I’m on a photo shoot?” all I have to do is reach out to my community. I am instantly inundated with all the information and knowledge out there on the subject.</p>

			<h2>A community of friends</h2>
<p>I have made some of my very best friends on Clickin Moms. My husband often jokes about my virtual friendships, but it is amazing how easy it is to find women that you click with (pun intended) on the forum.</p>
<p>From all over the world and from every background, I have found my tribe. We keep up on each others’ lives and find connection through our shared love of photography.</p>
<p>And when Clickin Moms hosts events where I finally get to meet these amazing women in person? I get so excited to see their faces in person, hear their voices, and hug their necks!</p>
<p>Where else are you going to find someone who gets it when you squeal with glee about Lightroom’s newest features? Or a friend who is willing to get up with you at 3:30 in the morning to trek to some epic sunrise location?!</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to meet some of the most amazing women through Clickin Moms that I otherwise never would have known. We’ve shared life through photography and beyond. I feel so fortunate to have been able to be a part of this community and form lifelong bonds.</p>

			<h2>A community</h2>
<p>Do you see a theme here? The most important part of Clickin Moms to me is that it is a <i>community</i>. It is a group of people who come together for the same purpose: to share their love of photography. It is a warm, supportive, fun environment and I feel incredibly lucky that I found it all those years ago.</p>
<p>And the most amazing part is that it always continues to grow and evolve. New tutorials are being added every day. New members are joining all the time. And new opportunities are presenting themselves.</p>
<p>As technology changes and new photographic trends are set, Clickin Moms will always be a place to go to for the most up-to-date information about it all. But it never loses its sense of close-knit community. It remains a place where everybody knows your name and everyone is rooting for your success.</p>

			<p>I have always been an introvert. I have never liked to be the center of attention. And for me, my it can be difficult to share my photography. Risk taking does not come naturally to me and opening myself up to critique or even praise is frightening.</p>
<p><i>Can you relate?</i></p>
<p>However, early in my photography journey I quickly learn that if I wanted to improve, I would have to overcome my fears. I would have to open up to get the photos I wanted. To receive the valuable feedback I needed, I would have to share my work.</p>
<p><i>I would have to be brave.</i></p>
<p>And if you are like me, the goal of improving as a photographer is enough to take that first step outside your comfort zone. Here are some ways that you can continue to overcome your fears and move toward your goals as a photographer.</p>

			<h2>Turn off your defense mechanism</h2>
<p>You know those voices in your head. They are the ones that say, “I’m not good enough. I shouldn’t share this. I look ridiculous. People will judge me. Who cares about my work?”</p>
<p>That’s your brain’s defense mechanism talking. Trust me, it isn’t some sixth sense intuition that is warning you of impending disaster. It’s merely your fear talking to you, making you second guess yourself.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>And you are not alone in these fears. <i>Every</i> person experiences self doubt from time to time. Even the most seasoned photographers still get nervous before a session or before submitting their work for judgement.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can turn those voices off! When those voices whisper to you, you ignore them. They aren’t what is going to make you a better photographer.</p>
<p>Is it scary? Heck yes! But if you listen to your fear talk to you, you will stay in the exact same place as you are now. We all have the voices of self doubt. But the photographers who improve and reach their goals are the ones who ignore the fear and push forward.</p>

			<h2>Take more risks</h2>
<p>You become physically stronger by lifting heavier things more often. You become stronger against your creative fears by pushing against them more often.</p>
<p>Turning off that inner voice is very much like physical exercise. Just like exercise, it’s painful when you begin a new routine. You want to give up. But if you keep going, your body adjusts to its new routine and you are able to stretch yourself further than you could in the beginning.</p>
<p>The same is true with brain training. In the beginning, even the smallest tasks may feel like monumental risks. Set small goals for yourself and take it one baby step at a time. Maybe that means posting to Instagram once a week for a couple of months. Or perhaps you can submit a picture share to the Clickin Moms forum once a month.</p>
<p>Eventually, these small risks can allow you to take bigger steps to grow in your photography. You might just find yourself putting together a professional portfolio or submitting to a magazine!</p>
<p>As your brain gets used to this sort of exercise, it gets easier and easier to turn off that fear and take risks. So after you conquer one fear, you can move onto the bigger dreams that you have for yourself.</p>

			<h2>Embrace rejection</h2>
<p>I know, I know. No one likes to hear “no.” Rejection is tough and especially when it comes to something that is as personal as your art, rejection can be downright terrifying.</p>
<p>In taking risks you will fail. You will get rejected. And yes, it’s incredibly disappointing when that happens. But honestly, the <i>fear</i> of rejection is often much worse than the actual rejection itself.</p>
<p>And know that you are in good company when you face rejection. Every single success story comes with more than a few tales of being told “no.” The people who find the “yeses” are the ones who don’t let the rejections defeat them.</p>
<p>So embrace the rejections as stepping stones to finding the opportunities that are perfect for you. Allow hearing “no” to motivate you to try harder, learn something new, and work for “yes” next time.</p>

			<h2>Make connections</h2>
<p>Sometimes being an introvert in a field like photography can feel incredibly isolating. You are a one-man show, creating art by yourself, and sometimes other photographers can feel like the enemy. The competition.</p>
<p>But there is <i>so</i> much to be gained by finding your community. There is value in being able to share and talk about your work with other like-minded creatives.</p>
<p>Really, who else will understand you when you lament about the lack of clouds in the sky during sunset? Who else can you ask for advice on whether to convert an image to black and white? And who else will support and encourage you when you start to give in to fear?</p>
<p>Having a sounding board when you have doubts and having a support system when fear creeps on can make all the difference in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>helping your overcome challenges.</p>
<p>A community should be a group that is not competing against one another. Rather, it should be artists but working together to build each other up. In a craft that is often lonely, community should make us each feel supported and less isolated. A community will make you more brave.</p>

			<h2>Don’t pay attention to social media</h2>
<p>I want you to post to social media. I want you to follow your community and lift other photographers up by commenting on their work. But for goodness’ sake, don’t count your followers or likes or comments. That will lead you down a path of empty comparisons and self doubt.</p>
<p>The point of sharing on social media is to put your work out into the world. It is not to gain validation or praise. Rather, it is to allow your art to be seen. It is a practice that allows you to see that your work deserves to be seen. It is a means to overcome your fears.</p>
<p>I want you to post to social media, and then I want you to ignore it for the rest of the day. Don’t look to see how many likes you’ve gotten. Don’t check to respond to comments throughout the day. Instead, let it sit out in the world before you attend to these things and bask in the pride of having overcome your fears.</p>

			<p>As I’ve learned to recognize and conquer my fears in the photography world, this ability has spilled over into other areas of my life too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find myself taking risks that I never would have before.</p>
<p>And this risk-taking has made my life so much more fun! Whether that’s singing karaoke at the school fundraiser (my 20-year-old self would have totally cringed at being the center of attention like that!) or introducing myself to a group of people when I don’t know anyone in a crowd, I am a much braver person than I was ten years ago.</p>
<p>So look inward and ask yourself if you have been holding back because of fear. If the answer is yes, start to let it go today. Start to open yourself and your art up to the world. Conquer the fears and be the photographer you were meant to be.</p>

			<p>Have you ever seen a scene that was almost symmetrical but not quite?</p>
<p>You know your composition would be strengthened immensely if only that scene were symmetrical. However, as it is, it doesn’t seem quite right.</p>
<p>Aside from changing the architecture in front of you, how can you make the frame work for your vision?</p>
<p>I took this image of my sister’s family at a tourist location in Chicago. Unfortunately, we weren’t the only tourists there that day!</p>
<p>I noticed the really nice balance of the two adults on either side of the frame with the two kids in between them. Their family created a wonderful backlit silhouette, framed nicely by the window casings. I loved the sense of connectedness they displayed and felt that this image would make such a great memory of their visit to Chicago.</p>
<p>But the nice framing and the symmetry of their bodies got lost because of the tourist on one side and the other distracting elements like the wires and computer sprinkled throughout the image. Having the vision in my head of what I wanted to create, I took the image into Photoshop.</p>
<p>In Photoshop, I copied a section from the right side of the image. Next, I flipped that section horizontally and then placed it on the left side of the image. Through the magic of layer masks, I was able to line up the copied section and blend it into the left side of the image.</p>
<p>Voila! Symmetry in my frame!</p>
<p>By converting it to black and white, I made the silhouettes even stronger and stripped away the color from the lights around them which distract the eye.</p>
<p>The final product has a much stronger composition than the original picture. The symmetry of the windows and architectural lines enhances the symmetry of the family, creating stability in the frame. Now the viewer’s eye focuses on just the four family members and their moment of togetherness.</p>
