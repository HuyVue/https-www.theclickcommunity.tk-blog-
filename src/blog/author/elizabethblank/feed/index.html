		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>When narrowing down the list of my 10 most favorite things, it’s no surprise my <a href="https://splwaterhousings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPL Water House</a> came in right at the top. I use the canary-yellow, A-series case all summer long to protect my Nikon D700 while underwater. While this model is not considered a “dive housing”, it is expertly built to easily handle depths of 15-20 feet and allows me to freely go under the surface while confidently knowing that my gear is safe and sound inside it’s aluminum-welded walls. This piece of gear is single-handedly responsible for my deep affection for underwater photography.</p>

When it comes time to shoot in water that is colder than my personal preference (my personal preference is right around 85* or higher &#8211; I’m a diva about being cold). It is considered minimalist protection for warm wave surfing &#8211; in my own words &#8211; just enough to take that the chill off. LOVE THIS THING. And just between us, you may sometimes find me wearing it on a 90 degree day if I don’t feel like shaving my legs. HA!!</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>I am a HUGE fan of musicals and I’d see one every week if possible. Someone once asked me if I was able to pick any art form in which I achieved mastery, what would it be? I immediately said, “Musical Theater!” It surprised the person asking the question, but not me. I’ve been obsessed with it since seeing <i>You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i> in second grade. Now, if only I could sing and dance. Since those skills are a bit lacking, I’m doing the next best thing: brainwashing….err&#8230;teaching my oldest to appreciate musical theater, as well. We recently saw <i>Hello, Dolly</i> and <i>Hamilton </i>in May and, let me tell you, those were two of the happiest days of the year for me so far! 🙂</p>

			<p>Old-school, classic bookstores. Can’t you smell it just thinking about it?! The crisp papers just stemming with possibility after possibility of the greatest stories ever told. I just love bookstores. I can spend hours perusing through them &#8211; checking out beautiful stationary and trying to convince myself that &#8211; no, in fact, I do NOT need another day planner to get me organized (I’m a tried and true pen and paper calendar girl over here!!). Bookstores are definitely a favorite of mine and my two summer favorite’s this year are Emily Giffin’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2NLIz3n" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>All We Ever Wanted</em></a> and Gray Malin’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2JXKQ9u" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Escape</em></a>.</p>

			<p>Summertime calls for laid-back routines and one of the things I fully embrace during this time of year is summer hair. I don’t have super curly hair by any means, but I definitely have a bit of wave throughout. I have found that <a href="https://amzn.to/2LOu8eh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Frieda’s Air Dry Waves</a> works wonders on my hair and gives me just the perfect amount of definition for those loose beach waves.</p>

			<p>This puppy doesn’t get too many days off during these summer months. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2LAjMCb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon 24mm f/1.4</a> is my workhorse and I adore her. She is always with me underwater (because she allows me to get the widest scene possible without introducing a ton of distortion) and is my number one lens to take on trips and vacations for the same reason. It is crisp, fast-to-focus and very versatile. Definitely one of my favorites!</p>

			<p>I find the process of designing a space to be such an exciting one. Not only is the space being brought to life, but you are also getting to see your vision come full circle. This year, we have been renovating our basement and it has been so exciting to see the project, which began as a concrete slab and a few studded out walls, become this beautiful space that feels so inline with my personal style. I love planning spaces in detail and then getting to see them become my reality. So excited to finally have a dedicated guest room and bath for visitors &#8211; now just to find the perfect bed!</p>

<p>Last year, I learned that we were expecting our third child and, within hours of learning this wonderful news, my brain was already beginning to think about how I could adequately capture this amazing, fleeting time.

			<p>It is funny, as a photographer, the thoughts that go through your head during major life events.</p>
<p>Last year, I learned that we were expecting our third child and, within hours of learning this wonderful news, my brain was already beginning to think about how I could adequately capture this amazing, fleeting time.</p>
<p>When I was pregnant with our first, I had not yet been bitten by the photography bug and the story of her entrance into the world is just a handful of images right after she was born. Fast forward three years later to the birth of my son and, while my passion for photography was certainly there, my focus was on getting precious newborn photos of him once he was home from the hospital and not on capturing the precious details surrounding his actual arrival. It wasn&#8217;t until a couple of months after his birth that I became very nostalgic over not having all of the little details preserved forever.</p>
<p>That is why, this time around, I knew things would be different.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, I would have hired a talented birth photographer and been very happy to hand over this huge responsibility to someone else. However, I knew my sweet girl would be making her entrance into this world via c-section and that having a birth photographer was not an option for me (<strong>My hospital has a strict policy about allowing only one &#8220;support person&#8221; in the OR during a c-section.</strong></p>
<p>I would be lying if I said that I didn&#8217;t think for a split second about having a birth photographer as my &#8220;plus one&#8221; in the OR, but figured my husband might like to actually see his daughter come into this world.). So, I got to work thinking about the shots that I knew I absolutely wanted to capture.</p>
<p>Seeing as how this was my third c-section, I did feel like I had a good idea of what to expect in terms of what shots I would actually be able to take, shots that I would need to delegate to someone else and shots that were just not feasible to capture. I broke my list into three different segments to make each one manageable: before delivery, during delivery, and after delivery.</p>
<p>When thinking about the photos that I knew I wanted to capture before my delivery, my mind instantly went to wanting to capture the details of the morning: the time and temperature when we left for the hospital, the weather, the drive to the hospital, a final shot of me and my belly, OR prep, etc. I knew that these shots would be easy for me to take because I would still be in complete control of the situation and my body. It also provided a really great distraction for me as the scheduled surgery time approached since I was focusing on something that I love instead of the impending procedure ahead.</p>

<p>Once the epidural was placed, I faithfully handed my camera over to my husband and told him to, &#8220;document everything and get creative with the shots&#8221;. In all honesty, at this point, my focus definitely shifted from being a photographer to being a soon-to-be mama of three. The nerves took over and I didn&#8217;t think much more about capturing the moment.</p>
<p>My husband, however, did a wonderful job in his new role as family photographer and absolutely captured moments that I want to remember forever. I do want to mention that before giving him the camera, I set the manual settings for what I anticipated the operating room to be like in terms of lighting and white balance.</p>
<p>What I did not anticipate was the very bright surgical light that would be directly above my girl as she was born. Some of her very first shots are very over-exposed. At first, I was really disappointed by this, but a few of them were salvageable and now I just look at the over-exposure in those images as a type of censorship, ha! Also important to note, I made certain the the file type was set to RAW as I knew that the images he took might need more editing than normal and I wanted to have the most flexibility later down the line with these images.</p>

<p>After the c-section was complete, I was wheeled to recovery where I stayed for a couple of hours. During this time, my husband still had the camera and was capturing everything as it happened &#8211; our girl, who we named Molly, being weighed, bathed, with our OB, etc. I did manage to capture some shots of my husband with Molly as they were wheeling me out of recovery to our post-partum room.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40708" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/daddy-meeting-baby-for-the-first-time-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg" alt="daddy meeting baby for the first time by Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="1152" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/daddy-meeting-baby-for-the-first-time-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/daddy-meeting-baby-for-the-first-time-by-Elizabeth-Blank-233x420.jpg 233w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/daddy-meeting-baby-for-the-first-time-by-Elizabeth-Blank-466x840.jpg 466w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Once we got to our post-partum room, the pressure to capture every fleeting moment as it was happening was suddenly no longer there. As the adrenaline of the day began to wear off and the pain meds began to set in, photography fell to the back-burner. I didn&#8217;t pick my camera back up until that evening when our older two met their sister for the first time. Since I could not get out of bed due to the epidural still being in place, I captured that special meeting as best as I could from my vantage point in the bed. In the end, the images from that night aren&#8217;t perfect by any means, but they will always be very special to me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40710" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sibling-meeting-new-baby-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg" alt="sibling meeting new baby by Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="1205" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sibling-meeting-new-baby-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sibling-meeting-new-baby-by-Elizabeth-Blank-223x420.jpg 223w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sibling-meeting-new-baby-by-Elizabeth-Blank-446x840.jpg 446w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sibling-meeting-new-baby-by-Elizabeth-Blank-371x700.jpg 371w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40709" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/family-holding-newborn-baby-in-hospital-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg" alt="family holding newborn baby in hospital by Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="347" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/family-holding-newborn-baby-in-hospital-by-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/family-holding-newborn-baby-in-hospital-by-Elizabeth-Blank-420x227.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>For the remainder of our hospital stay, I knew it was important to me that I document what our first four days were like in that room together. There is something so special, so fleeting, about the first days of life when the outside world seems to almost come to a standstill as you relish this new little wonder that has entered the world.</p>
<p>I will say that this part of the stay was the hardest for me to get motivated to shoot. I was very lucky that I was feeling pretty well after my c-section, but it is amazing what lack of sleep and medication can do to your overall general motivation. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have hired a professional photographer to come in for a &#8220;Fresh 24-48 Hour&#8221; session so that I could have had my main focus be solely on enjoying my precious girl.</p>
<p>Although a birth photographer was not an option for me in the delivery room, a Fresh 24 session was absolutely an option and, looking back, I do wish I had booked a session for this special time so that I would have been able to enjoy the experience while trusting that someone else was capturing it forever.</p>

<p>All in all, I am very aware that these images are not award-winning in terms of technicality and composition. That being said, these images are so very special to me because they tell our story. They capture details that will slip out of my memory as time passes. They will later show Molly just how anticipated and loved she was before she even took her first breath. When she is grown, these will be the images that I look back on and get a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach aching for times that once were – and any image that is capable of evoking emotion like that is considered a win for me.</p>
<p>So, if you find yourself in a situation where hiring a birth photographer is not an option, please know that you, with the help of others, can still absolutely capture the details of this life changing event… and even if they aren’t the most perfect images ever captured, they will still hold a very special place within your heart.</p>

<p>I initially chose Saturday, September 13th as my &#8220;day&#8221; because that was the day that I was traveling home from <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/clickaway/" target="_blank">Click Away</a> and, in my mind, it was going to be a calm day of travel filled with amazing architecture, interesting light and composition, and the comforts of home at the end of a long day. Well, isn&#8217;t it funny how our perception can be so different from actual reality? In reality, my day turned out to be a day that was solely documented through selfie reflections in dirty windows, sitting on tarmacs and airplane wings. And&#8230;as we all know from our Instagram feeds&#8230;once you&#8217;ve seen one airplane wing, you&#8217;ve pretty much seen them all. Ha!</p>

<p>So, I made the decision to document a couple of days later in an effort not to bore everyone. I flew from Salt Lake City to the Florida panhandle where my family was waiting for me for our annual beach get-away. These are truly some of the best days of  the year for our family and I knew I would cherish the images of our day together.</p>
<p>My day starts at 6:15 am when my youngest decides that it is time to rise and shine. She usually sleeps later than that at home, but we are in a different time zone and she is sleeping in a Pack &#8216;N Play right next to me. Any chance of her falling back asleep is immediately thrown out the window when she realizes that she has a couple of new roommates. I decide to make the best of this early morning wake up call and capture some images of just her which is a rare feat these days.</p>

<p>As we are shooting these, I realize that outside the sky is absolutely amazing. It looks like it might rain at any second so we run out to the shore before the clouds open up on us&#8230;but once we get outside, I realize that it actually looks like nicer weather is coming in.</p>

<p>After getting some pictures of her and enjoying our early morning on the beach together, we head back inside where everyone else is beginning to wake up. My awesome husband, who keeps us so well fed (seriously&#8230;if cooking was left up to me my poor family would probably starve to death), gets to work on breakfast and decides that we should have freshly squeezed lemonade with breakfast. This quickly becomes a family affair and everyone pitches in to help squeeze lemons, make a simple syrup and taste test. Obviously, the initial batch was just a bit too sour. More sugar stat!</p>

<p>(What? You guys don’t have one kid running around in just a diaper with a glitter tattoo of a dragon on his stomach and another kid who insists on wearing a flannel nightgown while at the beach? This situation is a perfect illustration of one of my favorite sayings, “Some battles are just NOT worth fighting!)</p>
<p>After breakfast, we quickly clean up and I run a bag of trash to the garbage. I leave the door cracked on my way out and my little guy decided he wants to come out and help me. How could I resist not capturing this?! (and I have a feeling these images will find there way back out when he starts dating!)</p>

<p>On our way back to the house, we look out at the ocean and are so excited to see a couple of dolphins just lazily swimming by (please excuse the quality of this image &#8211; I was kicking myself for not having a better long distance lens with me!). We actually saw schools of dolphins every single day of our trip and it blew my mind each and every time!</p>

<p>After dolphin watching for a bit, we head inside and get ready for the day. Since it is still kind of dreary out, my oldest and I make plans to go explore the surrounding beach towns with some friends who are also at the beach with us this week. We have a blast exploring, shopping and having ice cream&#8230;until one of us gets a big, huge blister and has a full on melt-down.</p>

<p>After the epic meltdown, we head back to the beach house just as the sun is beginning to come out.  While we&#8217;ve been gone, the little ones have gone down for their naps and we come home to a calm house. We decide that it is time to dip our toes in the water, so we get lathered and suited up and head out to enjoy an afternoon on the beach. Annie&#8217;s toe is still hurting her, so we decide to take a walk down the beach. We have a blast and are even able to find a perfect sand dollar.</p>

<p>Around this time, the littles wake up from their naps and it is now beach time for everyone! We run inside to get them ready and we are back on the beach in no time. Harrison, our sweet &#8220;middle child&#8221;, is particularly afraid of the ocean this trip. He is quite content lounging in his pool right beside the ocean, thankyouverymuch. So, that is were he spent most of his days (and I&#8217;d be totally lying if said that I didn&#8217;t just start singing &#8220;chillin&#8217; at nights and relaxin&#8217; all cool&#8221; after typing the last sentence. +2 points for anyone who gets that reference! Ha!).</p>

<p>The afternoon is perfection. Everyone is in awesome moods (for the most part), had great naps, and are getting along with one another. A trifecto of awesome family time, if you will! This is amazing!! (and short lived…)</p>

<p>We realize it is getting later and later and we have a family photography session tonight that we need to get ready for. As we begin packing up our beach gear, this dog runs by. Y’all, this dog seriously made my day and I&#8217;m lucky that I just happened to have my camera in my hand because if I hadn’t, I would have never been able to capture him. I am almost certain that I have never seen an animal happier to be alive. His joy over terrorizing the seagulls gave me a huge smile as we went inside for the evening. (I know the sequence below seems like it is out of order, but if you start on the right and then work your way towards the left, that is exactly how I viewed him zooming by me).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38869" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/A-day-in-the-life-with-Atlanta-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-26.jpg" alt="A day in the life with Atlanta photographer Elizabeth Blank " width="640" height="144" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/A-day-in-the-life-with-Atlanta-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-26.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/A-day-in-the-life-with-Atlanta-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-26-420x94.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Once we get back inside, everyone eats dinner (a very healthy dinner of macaroni and cheese and hotdogs, might I add. Ha! Don&#8217;t judge!) and gets showered. I get to work ironing clothes for our family session with <a href="http://kansaspitts.com/" target="_blank">Kansas Pitts Photography</a>. We have about one hour to get five people fed, showered and looking presentable. Things are hectic, but we somehow make it all work. I put the kids in the car in their underwear out of fear that they might wrinkle their clothes and I now have a deep appreciation for everything my clients do in order to prepare for a shoot with me.</p>

<p>We make it to our session on time and I’m thrilled to meet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kansaspittsphotography" target="_blank">Kansas</a>. I’ve been a long-time admirer of her work and was so happy that we were able to schedule a session with her while we were in town. She has the patience of a saint and she really was able to utilize her patience on my family during our session. My kids were terrible, y’all. Like really bad. Remember how I said Harrison hated the ocean? Well, he REALLY hated it tonight. And, remember how Annie got that blister earlier today? Well, the protective layer of skin came off right before our session started so any salt water that got on her foot caused her to go into hysterics. It was quite an interesting shoot…and only makes me think of another one of my many sayings…”If I didn’t laugh, I’d cry…” See what I mean? (photo credit: Kansas Pitts)</p>

<p>Even though my children were not the most cooperative, Kansas is a photography genius and the images that I’ve seen from our session so far make any pain and anguish that was felt so incredibly worth it. I will cherish these images forever.</p>

<p>After our session, we head back to our house and begin getting the kids in bed. My husband and I then get ourselves ready to go out for a fun night with friends. All of the schools in our area are on Fall Break, so we have quite a few friends who are vacationing in the same area this week. In addition, our go-to babysitter from home is also in Florida and is headed over to keep our rug rats. We are excited to get to have some adult time tonight and we quickly meet up with everyone at The Red Bar where we have a phenomenal meal, listen to awesome live music and enjoy wonderful company.</p>

<p>As we wrap up dinner, I snap my last picture of the day&#8230;one of just me. It has been a long day, but a truly wonderful day. I go to sleep tonight with a fresh reminder of just how lucky I am to have a life filled with these people who I love so much and wonderful opportunities to spend such awesome quality time together. Thank you so much for tagging along on my day!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-31691 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-640x640.jpg" alt="the ultimate photo journey of Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-640x640.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-310x310.jpg 310w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-216x217.jpg 216w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-700x700.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-ultimate-photo-journey-of-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I can honestly date my love of photography back to the late 1980&#8217;s when my aunt and uncle gave me my very first camera for Christmas &#8211; the beautiful, hot pink Le Clic that only took disc film. I loved that camera with every fiber of my being and adored capturing moments through its lens.</p>
<p>After that camera bit the dust, I moved onto the Polaroid i-Zone and the Canon PowerShot. Did I know anything about shooting in manual, composition or processing? Nope, absolutely not. But, I did know that I adored the feeling of capturing a fleeting moment on a permanent medium.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2008 &#8211; Around this time, I found a few photographers online whose work I thoroughly enjoyed following. I was immediately drawn to clean, crisp images with vivid colors and I knew that I wanted to learn how to create that. Throughout that year, I mentioned to my husband, quite a few times, that I would love a &#8220;nice camera&#8221; to document our life. On Christmas Eve, 2008, the UPS man dropped off the best present ever &#8211; my new Nikon D90 with a kit lens.</p>
<p>I had NO idea how to work the D90 (the night I received it, I thought it was broken because so much of the LCD screen was &#8220;blinking&#8221; back at me after I took a photo. Ha!) and used it as a point and shoot the entire first year I had it. During this year, our first daughter was born and I was adamant about capturing all of her sweet milestones, however, I was doing so in auto mode and I had no control over the images I was creating.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31683 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-1.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank " width="640" height="1702" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-1-263x700.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I still longed for the gorgeous images I was seeing online, but was unable (obviously!) to make those images a reality. At the end of 2009, my husband really encouraged me to fully learn the capabilities of my camera and expand my knowledge of photography. Two local photographers, who I still credit so much of my growth to, had recently launched a series of photography workshops and I decided that this would be the place to formally start my journey. After one four hour course where I learned to shoot in manual mode, I was hooked and never again turned my camera to anything other than the manual &#8220;M&#8221;. After the Intro course, I took additional courses and my obsession for all things photography officially started. At the time, my daughter was about 8 months and unable to run from my camera, so many hours were spent practicing on her. I also joined a couple of different photography forums, <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com" target="_blank">Clickin Moms</a> being one, and delved into the world of exposure, white balance, post-processing, and everything else that revolves around digital photography.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31684 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-2.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank " width="640" height="1765" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-2-112x310.jpg 112w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-2-232x640.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>A few months later, with a new 50mm 1.8 on my camera, I started getting requests from friends and neighbors to take photographs of their children. I was thrilled to do so and to learn on subjects other than my poor, over-photographed one year old and decided to begin portfolio building at this time.</p>
<p>To be honest, I jumped in feet first without properly preparing myself to start a business. If I could go back in time, I would have taken things much more slowly, but, alas, I didn&#8217;t and all of these tiny details now play out in my overall story. Hindsight is 20/20 they say, and now, looking back, I wish I had just relaxed a bit at first and been comfortable in knowing that I didn&#8217;t have to take on every family that requested a session. However, these first sessions taught me many things about photography and reiterated that I still had a ton to learn. My first full year was fraught with inconsistent exposure, missed focus, white balance nightmares and a lack of post-processing knowledge. On the flip side, this year was also met with an escalating penchant for all things photography and an unyielding desire to learn. I had definitely been bitten by the bug.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31685 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-3.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank " width="640" height="2128" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-3-93x310.jpg 93w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The next year, 2011, brought with it a good bit of growth in the photography realm, but it also left me aching for more: more knowledge, more time, just more. I can remember falling asleep at night and just wishing there were more hours in the day to learn this craft faster than I was able to.</p>
<p>At this time, I was still working part-time in a job I loved, but that took a lot out of me. Add on top of that many late nights devoted to continually learning about photography, running a photography business (that I was NOT well-versed in doing, I have my masters in education for crying out loud!) and weekend shoots and I was one tired girl. In October, 2011, we learned that we were expecting our second child and it was decided that, at the end of the school year, I would leave the school system and focus solely on being a mom and a photographer. As much as I knew I&#8217;d miss working with students on a daily basis, this was a very freeing decision for me. 2011 also brought with it some big changes in the equipment department as I hung up my D90 in exchange for the D700 and my lens collection began to grow with the addition of the 50mm 1.4, 24-70mm 2.8 and 85mm 1.4.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31686 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-4.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank " width="640" height="2552" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of 2012, I decided to invest more into my photography journey and decided that it would be very beneficial for me to take a couple of workshops that year. I started by attending a one-on-one newborn workshop with <a href="http://www.kerimeyersphotography.com/" target="_blank">Keri Myers</a>. When I arrived, I joked with Keri that she was my last ditch effort for falling in love with newborns and, wouldn&#8217;t you know, 48 hours later I was absolutely totally smitten with documenting these precious little ones.</p>
<p>Also, in April of 2012, I attended an in-person workshop with <a href="http://www.megbitton.com/" target="_blank">Meg Bitton</a>. The two days I spent with Meg and a group of 10 other very talented photographers was one I will always hold dear. It was a very validating, eye-opening experience and one that I still feel the effects of today. I definitely walked away from that workshop with a better understanding of who I was as a photographer and what I wanted my images to represent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31687 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-5.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="1702" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-5.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-5-263x700.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The rest of 2012 was a blissful transition from mom-of-one to mom-of-two and re-engaging in the Clickin Moms community. It&#8217;s amazing how much time you all of a sudden have when nursing a baby for multiple hours a day. I used that time to continue learning as much as I could through online tutorials and forums. I applied for <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmpro/" target="_blank">CMpro</a> at the end of 2012 and was very honored to be accepted into such an amazing group of photographers.</p>
<p>2013 brought with it a booming photography business, which I will forever be grateful for, and the realization that I was truly committed to making my business a success story. It also brought with it another sweet baby girl who we welcomed into the world on December 18, 2013.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31688 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-6.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Atlanta Georgia photographer Elizabeth Blank" width="640" height="888" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-6.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-6-223x310.jpg 223w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-6-461x640.jpg 461w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-photography-journey-of-Atlanta-Georgia-photographer-Elizabeth-Blank-6-504x700.jpg 504w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Thus far, 2014 has been a balancing act of figuring out how to care for three small children while still maintaining my photography business. I am continually amazed that I have been able to create work for myself within a profession that I truly love. I know that my photography journey will never be fully complete and that it will continue to ebb and flow as time moves on. I am thrilled to be on this journey and look forward to seeing what is still in store for me!</p>
