			<p>I believe we are all storytellers. But as we are mastering our craft, we can find ourselves so absorbed by the new concept or technique we are trying to learn that we often end up neglecting the story.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The purpose of a photograph is to <i>say something</i>. Sure, we have to learn the technical aspects of light, the exposure triangle, composition, and so much more. But all of those skills are learned so that we can better communicate with our audiences.</p>
<p>Storytelling is always happening in photographs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> Both beginners and seasoned photographers are conveying narratives through their images but with different levels of intention, complexity and ease.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As we begin to understand our visual voice, it’s much like learning a new language. We first learn to make simple and concrete sentences. Eventually we are able to express more complex and abstract thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>Find your story</h2>
<p>Most of the time, we see a moment, snap a photo or two, and then put the camera down. Then later, we look at our photos and find that they are just okay. Which is a bummer because there was a story in that moment and we wanted to capture it!</p>
<p>So next time you see a moment that makes you reach for your camera, take a second to identify the story. What emotions do you want to express in your photograph? What characters, plotlines, and actions are guiding the moment? Spend the time to identify what about the scene draws you in and work to photograph <i>that.</i></p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Take some time to plan. Think about the story you want to tell with your image. Ask yourself questions to create a detailed plan to help you find your story.</p>
<p>Who is your audience? Who are the characters in your story? What is the best location, environment, or backdrop for your story? What time of day or year will best illustrate your story? Do you want to photograph the plot (main story) or is your story more about a struggle or a happy ending? What is the title of your image? What is the intended mood? Can you identify details that you should include so that a stranger can understand your story?</p>

			<p>In this image, I was shooting a family session with my partner. Typically when we shoot together, we alternate from primary to secondary shooter throughout the session. In this instance, while he was capturing the family playing together with this orange ball. I was on the sidelines capturing different perspectives.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, all I could see were this little boy’s legs. A title instantly popped into my head: “friendless”. I quickly positioned myself to emphasize the loneliness (lot of greens and negative space) and waited for the ball to come close to his feet. Click!</p>
<p>In this moment, I saw that *my* story was going to be different from that of my partner’s. It was this little moment alone on the ledge. Once I found my story, I was able to get my photo.</p>

			<h2>Choose your angle</h2>
<p>Now that you know the story you want to shoot, it’s time to pick the right angle. Your position in relation to your subject is key in creating a strong image. You need to decide which angle will best tell your story.</p>
<p>Who will tell the story? Will it be a removed narrator, an active participant, or the subject himself? What is the best point of view to illustrate this point of view? From above? From below? At eye level? From behind?</p>
<p>As decisive moments don’t last forever, I recommend first taking a safe shot and then changing your point of view until you find the optimal angle. A less-than-ideal photo of a magical memory is always better than no photo at all!</p>

			<p>In this image, I began by shooting from the side so my subjects would be facing my camera. It was my safe (and kind of boring) shot.</p>
<p>Once I had the moment captured, I started to move around. First I moved behind my son (the boy in the back of the final frame) but didn’t like that the girl was hidden in the picture. I moved again and ended up behind dad and daughter (and hoped for the best for my lens!).</p>
<p>I liked the fact that this point of view gave the viewer the feeling of being right in the action. Even better, I was able to capture this extra layer of splash to add depth while also including the antagonist (my son) in the frame. From this perspective, I am able to construct a more complete story.</p>

			<p>This is an image of my son writing his letter to Santa. (It’s in French…he wasn’t writing to Cher!). While he was writing, I tried different things but found that the story I was striving toward was incomplete. I tried creating a double exposure. I tried capturing this as a dramatic low light image.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I was getting far from my initial intention. Him simply writing a letter was the story and <i>that</i> was what I wanted to capture.</p>
<p>Again, an idea popped into my head: the letter to Santa would be a pretext to document his six-year-old handwriting. I chose the “participant” angle and the “from above” perspective and captured an image I really like!</p>

			<h2>Structure your story</h2>
<p>If you were writing a 1000 word essay, you would structure your ideas according to their relevance and importance to effectively communicate your story. Even the best story fails if the ideas within it are not structured properly.</p>
<p>In photography, we structure our images using composition techniques. You can utilize leading lines, framing elements, and implied triangles to guide your viewer through the frame.. This will take your audience on a visual path where the elements of the story are organized in such a way that the story makes sense.</p>

			<p>This image is an example of implied triangles. Do you see them? Our eyes naturally connect the points of interest to form a natural shape. Here, the mother’s gaze acts as an indirect line which leads us to her first born who is looking outside of the frame. This can weaken an image as it throws our eyes out of the frame. However in this case, with the help of the triangle our eyes stay in the frame. There are many other triangles in this image: Mother’s arm, mother’s face, son. Mother’s face, son, newborn. Mother’s arm, bottle of milk, newborn. Can you find more?</p>

			<p>The image here is an example of using leading lines (the path), centering with intention (subjects are at the vanishing point) and including a framing element (the arch of the aquarium). I also used a lot of negative space around them to echo the quietness of the family and the silence of the underwater world.</p>
<p>You should also learn to avoid certain things that can weaken your message. Ineffective composition, unintentionally chopping limbs, or failing to isolate your subject from the background can all work against your story.</p>
<h2>Add depth to your story</h2>
<p>I am not talking about just physical depth here. Though of course you should seek out opportunities for adding dimensionality to the frame. Rather, I am talking about looking for opportunities to add emotional depth to your imagery.</p>
<p>Compositional elements are truly helpful in reinforcing depth in your narrative. You can use juxtaposition to accentuate differences between contrasting elements in your frame. Use a reflection to emphasize the importance of a character or to show something the viewer otherwise couldn’t see. Explore how negative space helps you create mood.</p>

			<p>I love this image of my daughter running away. She was biking and decided to stop to take a sip from the sprinkler. And of course she got all wet! She ran to the patio door for her dad to dry her. I decided to use the bike and the sprinkler in the foreground as a layer. I then placed my daughter in the middle ground of the frame and my house in the background. The layers of abandoned fun and golden sunlight add both physical and emotional depth as the child who would be expected to have fun with them runs away.</p>
<h2>Compose and capture your story</h2>
<p>Once your plan is well thought out visualize your plan and carefully compose your frame, you wait for your moment.<b> </b>This is what we call “macro-composition.” Of course, these are guidelines! In real life, we make these decisions on the fly and we correct our plan while looking through the viewfinder! We take the safe shot and then we improve on our composition to strengthen our storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/better-snapshots-elements-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just a snapshot? How to use composition to make better photos</a></strong></p>
<p>Picture yourself in the shoes of a hunter. Instead of hunting down a prey, you are hunting the decisive moment in the scene unfolding in front of you. You have already determined that you are in the best possible position to capture your story. Commit to your composition and wait for your characters to move into your frame.</p>
<p>Coordinate your ideas. Your task consists of micro-adjusting your macro-composition to make sure your image follows the rules and guidelines of composition (subject isolation, depth of field, no limb chops, etc.). Move your feet a tad, incline or tilt your camera a little, make subtle changes to your point of view until you achieve nice subject separation.</p>
<p>Shoot through the scene. You want to capture your subjects in the right light, with a great expression, doing the right thing at the perfect moment for your story. All of this without forgetting the aforementioned rules of composition. The smallest details can mean the difference between making art and taking a snapshot.</p>

			<h2>Isolate your subject</h2>
<p>Isolating your subject doesn’t mean that you have to put him in an empty room in order to photograph him. Rather, it means that you need to make it your goal to let you subject shine. You want the focus of your photograph to be the first thing your audience sees, right?!</p>
<p>These are some of my favorite ways to isolate subjects:</p>
<p>•Using aperture to blur the background</p>
<p>•Keeping the subject far away from background elements</p>
<p>•Placing the subject in an empty space</p>
<p>•Placing the subject in great light</p>
<p>•Ensure a bright subject is on a darker background OR</p>
<p>•Ensure a dark subject is on a brighter background</p>
<p>•Utilize composition (ie: the rule of thirds, leading lines, framing elements)</p>

			<h2>Place your subject properly within the frame</h2>
<p>The easiest way to improve your photos RIGHT NOW, is to avoid cropping at the joints (knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, throat). To have the edges of the frame running through these joints is uncomfortable (the term “limb chop” sounds bad for a reason!). So take a step back and make sure that your composition allows your subject to be comfortably within the frame.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>

	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Similarly, don’t have horizontal lines (ie: horizon lines and background elements) running through these joints. This can be a little tricky as we don’t always notice that pole or tree behind our subject when we are happily shooting away. However, I promise that taking a minute to ensure that nothing is “impaling” your subject (yikes!) will yield stronger photographs every time.</p>

			<p>In this example, my dark subjects are on a brighter background. They are framed by the horizon line and they are in a clean space. Their limbs are fully within the photograph and the light is beautiful.</p>
<h2>Add depth to your image</h2>
<p>How does one add depth to a two-dimensional photograph, you ask? By carefully constructing a frame that has elements in the foreground, the middle ground, and the background. Doing so will create a sense of space that will make your photographs so much stronger.</p>
<p>Sometimes a simple portrait calls for only a singular subject with no other elements in the frame. And that is fine! However, when you want to tell a deeper story with your photographs, you need to use every millimeter in your picture!</p>
<p>You want your viewers feel as though they can move through the frame and into the story themselves. Here are some simple ways to add depth:</p>
<p>•Put something in the foreground (but don’t let it distract from your subject…nothing too bright or eye-catching)</p>
<p>•Opt for a point of view where we can see the environment</p>
<p>•Close your aperture to keep desirable elements in focus</p>
<p>•Use light intentionally (backlight allows the sun to be the background element!)</p>
<p>•Place cool colors at the back and warm colors at the front of your image, and vice versa, to see how colors recede and emerge (this is a great trick I learned in Fine Art and Visual Expression with Elle Walker)</p>

<h2>Balance the frame with light and shadows</h2>
<p>Creating a balanced frame means to create a path for the viewer’s eyes to “read” the photograph. Our eyes read from what is bright to what is dark. We search for geometrical forms. Our brain is drawn to the color red. We are automatically attracted first to human forms, faces, and eyes.</p>
<p>If you do not have light on your subject or if the brightest light has fallen elsewhere, it can lead to an imbalanced frame. Should red occur in an area of the frame that is unimportant, it can distract the viewer from your intended subject.</p>
<p>In other words, creating balance means that you have organized the photograph in a way that guides your viewer to your subject first and does not pull them away from that intended focal point.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of how red can grab our attention, even when it’s out of focus. In this frame, the bike was part of the story of a bike ride that didn’t end well. But for someone who doesn’t know the back story, it might be distracting.</p>
<h2>Work to get accurate white balance</h2>
<p>Color in photographs can be such a difficult thing to see at first. Our brains are wired to autocorrect when there is a color cast that we know is wrong.</p>
<p>However, achieving correct white balance can make all the difference in the effectiveness of a photograph. I urge you to learn how to edit skin by the numbers. Using these mathematical baselines will help you retrain your eyes and will eventually make seeing and editing correct white balance second nature.</p>

			<p>There will always be trends in post processing, but if the white balance is weird, that’s all I can see! Feel free to explore new techniques but don’t allow yourself to be the victim of passing fads. Having solid white balance is crucial to creating timeless work.</p>
<h2>Avoid in-between moments and distracting elements</h2>
<p>When looking at your work, don’t put “mommy goggles” on. This is not to say that you shouldn’t take a few of those super close-up shots of that adorable toddler (because that is what I did and while they isn’t likely appealing to anyone else, I know those shots are just screaming LOOK HOW AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL MY SON IS!). Instead, I want you to take those shots and then be intentional in taking shots that tell the story of your subjects.</p>
<p>Don’t forget you are taking pictures for your kids so they will be able to remember and relive their childhood. So, look at your favorite images. Do they tell the story of a moment? Or do they capture a moment that is more in-between?</p>
<p>Be intentional. Know why you are shooting. Choose your settings to support the story. Click. Look at the back of your camera. Move. Repeat.</p>

			<p>For many of us, when we begin our photography journey our first images are often &#8220;close-ups&#8221; of our babies.</p>
<p>Then, as they grow older, we continue shooting them from the same perspective, our perspective. Our perspective consists of us shooting mostly from in front of them.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to vary your point of view? I don’t necessarily mean shooting from above, below, behind or at eye level. Even though these different perspectives add variety to your pictures, I want to invite you today to think about the point of view in the story.</p>
<p>I don’t necessarily mean shooting from above, below, behind or at eye level. Even though these different perspectives add variety to your pictures, I want to invite you today to think about the point of view in the story.</p>
<p>The point of view (POV) in photography is simply the editorial choice you make each time you take a picture, to tell and strengthen a story.</p>
<p>When considering the point of view from a storytelling perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to tell a story from the narrator&#8217;s perspective, a participant&#8217;s perspective or from the viewpoint of an observer of the story?</li>
<li>Do you want the viewer to contemplate something or to be part of the action?</li>
<li>What do you want to showcase in the particular scene that you are about to capture: emotion, connection, action, quest, plot, a happy ending or struggle?</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that I want to emphasize is that there is no right of wrong POV because each POV will simply tell a different story. The thing that is important is to know what you want to say and then be sure your POV helps you to say it.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will show you either a single image, or a series of images of the same moment, and will discuss how the point of view strengthens the image.</p>
<h2>Shooting to show connection: choose a POV where the eye contact or the hands are the star.</h2>
<p>One way to illustrate connections in your story is to include eye contact or your subject&#8217;s hands in your image. The eye contact can be with you or between the people within your frame. You can achieve it by being close to your subject or at a distance, depending on what you are trying to showcase. Filling your frame with the connection can really have a deep impact on the viewer.</p>

<p>In this picture, I wanted to highlight this new mother’s gaze and her gently touching her baby’s hair. I also loved the light that was in this bedroom and I thought it helped contribute to the connection. So instead of filling the frame, I backed up a little and showed the entire scene, carefully framing the subjects so as not to include other elements that would have been distracting. I chose to shoot this from slightly above to flatter mom’s face and showcase the delicate light on her shoulder, bringing feminity to this image.</p>

<p>In this one, the point of view showcases the love and the energy of the boy. Having them so close to the camera makes the emotion almost tangible.</p>

<h2>Shooting from the point of view of a voyeur to show things that you are not supposed to see, good or bad!</h2>
<p>This point of view can be achieved by shooting as if you were hidden like paparazzi. You can use a door frame, window, mirror, or foliage to shoot through to suggest that you are &#8220;peeking in&#8221; on a scene. This point of view is effective when you see something naughty, bad behavior, or when you capture a stolen moment!</p>
<p>In this picture, I shot through the door frame and included the door in my image to help the viewer feel that my kids are doing something out of their parents sight and more specifically, something that they are not supposed to do! (Although I did provide the water bottle on this occasion for my image)</p>

<p>Here, I was trying to get a family picture in their new courtyard. After a quick celebratory toast, they decided to kiss. Thankfully I was still holding the shutter button and stole this tiny moment.</p>

<p>In this image, I didn’t want to disturb my son while he was drying his scooter. He hated my camera in those days so I preferred to hide behind the foliage. This POV allowed me to capture the concentration on his face which really added to the story.</p>

<h2>Shooting from behind &#8211; the tricky one!</h2>
<p>For the last year, because our family has been living in another country, I have been very drawn to taking images of my children from behind. Why? Sometimes, it is because I want to do more of a landscape photograph and I don’t want their faces to detract from the scene.</p>

			<h2>Shooting from your point of view while being involved in the action.</h2>
<p>In this shot, I was literally behind dad and daughter, experiencing the activity. As you can see, my camera even got soaked! That’s why for me, the story is told from a narrator&#8217;s point of view. This is, of course, a participatory image as you can almost feel the water hitting you behind your screen!</p>

<h2>Shooting from below to emphasize a character in your story.</h2>
<p>Here, instead of following the “villain”, I chose to place myself in a narrator&#8217;s point of view to focus on the emotions on their faces and to make the viewer feel something. I was also slightly below them to make my son look bigger and to be sure to get his evil expression!</p>
<p>Actually, this picture is my son’s favorite! He laughs aloud each time he sees it on the screensaver!</p>

<h2>Shooting from a distance to capture a contemplative moment or to use the environment to add a storytelling element.</h2>
<p>In all these pictures, I needed the environment to tell the story. Here the story is not about a connection, it’s more about an atmosphere.</p>

			<h3>Case study 1: same point of view, two images</h3>
<p>These two pictures are the same frame, but cropped differently.</p>
<p>This is the original. My first thought was to get low to capture the sun to add to the story. In my mind, the sunlight was enhancing the joy in this moment. This POV, to me, is more about the joyful atmosphere instead of focusing on their connection, even though the connection is undoubtedly there.</p>

<p>Back at home, I decided to try this thigh crop, “just to see”. In my opinion, this picture really showcases their connection and the fun they were having together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included this example to illustrate that with the exact same point of view, you can tell a different story, sometimes it is very subtle and sometimes it detracts. Choosing how much environment you put in your frame should aways be in your decision process because it can make or break your image.</p>

<p>This POV, where I was slightly more on their right and shooting at sand level, broke the image. There is too much environment, bringing distracting elements into the frame and the mother&#8217;s body position is unflattering. Also, we can&#8217;t see the daughter&#8217;s face very well. In the previous shot, I positioned myself better in order to hide this distracting man!</p>

<h3>Case study 2: two different POV &#8211; one sleeping baby</h3>
<p>Although a few months between images, these photos are of the same baby in the same crib but from two different point of views.</p>
<p>In the first one, I was above her and using the crib as a leading line and as a framing element. My only thought when I composed this image was “she is gorgeous while she is sleeping”. Nothing more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61008" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis.jpg" alt="In this tutorial, I will show you either a single image, or a series of images of the same moment, and will discuss how the point of view strengthens the image." width="1900" height="1267" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis.jpg 1900w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photo-of-girl-sleeping-in-bed-by-Annick-Paradis-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1900px) 100vw, 1900px" /></p>
<p>In this shot, I chose to shoot very close to her and at her eye level through the cot. It created a blurred foreground that suggests dreaminess.</p>
<p>Each time I look at this picture, my thought is “She is so calm, lost in her dreams. I want to pat her cheek but I don’t want to wake her”. To me this is really a stolen moment.</p>

<h3>Case study 3: 3 perspectives on a fun moment</h3>
<p>Finally, here is an example of 3 pictures taken within 10 seconds, capturing the same moment, from different points of view.</p>
<p>From behind and down low, the fun activity and movement are showcased and it emphasized the height of this human pyramid. Including the sun also contributes to the feeling of joy and happiness.</p>

<p>Being in front of the subjects and at their eye level, I was able to showcase more of the action and the struggle. I chose not to include the sun, instead choosing to enhance the feeling of the “struggle”. This is a subtle difference but it does change the story.</p>

<p>From below and in front of them, the emotion and the connections are highlighted because we can see their faces and their smiles. Being below them adds some drama, enhancing their height and suggesting an increasing risk of falling over!</p>

<p>On that note, I encourage you to try new points of view in a very deliberate way. When you are shooting a scene, try to give it a title and ask yourself if your actual point of view contributes to telling the story to a complete stranger. If not, what can you change?</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see the point of view you will choose in your story!</p>

			<p>For a while now, I have wanted to find a way to capture in an image one facet of my daughter’s personality: her strong independence.</p>
<p>I was looking for an opportunity for a long time and in January, during our holiday in Tasmania, the moment happened.</p>
<p>We were at the edge of a big dark forest and a golf course, on the yard I hired for that night. When my daughter saw the gravel, she sat there and played. I asked her to follow me as there were plenty of wallabies on the golf course and I wanted to include them in a picture.</p>
<p>Miss Independent said: NO (of course).</p>
<p>So to test her, I continued on my way and took a picture of the wildlife, maybe 50 meters from where my daughter played. Although I hoped she would follow me, she stayed where she was and didn’t look at me at all. But I was looking at her!</p>
<p>As I watched, I had my “a-ha” moment and decided it was the perfect time to frame her independence!</p>
<p>She was sitting in a tiny patch of light just in front of the dark forest. It was the blue hour and there was little available light left. My first thought was to showcase her independence in a contrasty way.</p>
<p>I backed up far from her, laid down in the gravel and put my camera on the ground. I metered for her and shot this image with my <a href="http://amzn.to/2mUijHG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canon 24-105mm f4 lens</a> at 105mm.</p>
<h2>Why did I make these choices?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metering for her:</strong> I wanted the contrast of her in the light against the darkness of the forest. If I had metered for the scene it would have made the entire scene appear brighter than it was and the grass at the bottom would have been blown out.</li>
<li><strong>105 mm focal length:</strong> I wanted to use compression to make the forest appear as close as it felt in reality. Choosing a wider lens would have produced a different effect.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing the distance between me and the subject:</strong> I made this choice as I wanted to emphasize how small she was against those tall trees. I needed the height of the trees in my frame, so I needed that 24mm “wide” look and backed up a lot. Plus, I am a wide angle shooter and like to include the environment in my images!</li>
<li><strong>Laying down:</strong> I wanted to have my daughter at the very bottom of the frame, so the height contrast between the trees and her would be even greater.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, as I was waiting for the perfect moment to capture her independence, the light went by and my overall idea was not well captured within the raw image. Here is the raw, which is very dark and cool:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59734" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis.jpg" alt="" width="1067" height="1600" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis.jpg 1067w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-280x420.jpg 280w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-560x840.jpg 560w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-400x600.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-600x900.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-photo-from-Annick-Paradis-800x1200.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px" /></p>
<p>Back at home after my holidays, I had two options in mind for editing the image.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit it to tell the story I had in mind while shooting, a threatening giant black forest and a little girl in a pocket of light .</li>
<li>Edit it with my usual personal preset that is bright and happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose to do both, just to see how different the images would be in terms of storytelling.</p>
<p>So, as you will see, editing is not only a matter of taste, it is also a way to showcase the story behind your image, and then, your voice.</p>

<p>I achieved my vision by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the exposure almost the same as the SOOC.</li>
<li>Keeping the white balance cool over the trees and adding a warmer white balance where my daughter is located.</li>
<li>Keeping the tones cool using the hue slider to retain the blue hour feeling.</li>
<li>Bumping the clarity slider to make the trees pop.</li>
<li>Opening the shadows a tad to reveal more trees which were hidden in the darkness.</li>
<li>Adding a very strong curve to bring back the whites and the highlights that were critically missing.</li>
<li>Desaturating the greens, because they were too yellowish after the first tweaks I made.</li>
<li>Decreasing the luminance to make it rich and dark.</li>
<li>Adding a graduated filter at the bottom and increasing the exposure and the whites in the patch of light.</li>
<li>Adding a strong vignette to keep the moody look.</li>
<li>Playing with the Split Toning panel to get warmer highlights and greener/bluer shadows.</li>
<li>Tweaking the colors in the Camera Calibration panel to make the greens “greener”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tada! This is really what I had in mind and this edit conveyed the mood of the moment the image was taken.</p>
<p>Now, here is a second edit using my usual editing process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59737" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brighter-photo-of-outdoor-lifestyle-image-by-Annick-Paradis.jpg" alt="For a while now, I have wanted to find a way to capture in an image one facet of my daughter’s personality: her strong independence.

<p>It is warmer, the vibrance and saturation have been bumped, the hue sliders are on the warm side and the white balance is on the neutral side. The shadows and the blacks are very open and while the RGB curve is the same as the previous image, I added a Red curve to add more warmth to the picture.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it is telling another story and the blue hour has disappeared. She is still small against the trees, but this is less threatening and only showcases a candid little girl.</p>
<p>Here are the two versions side by side:</p>

<h2>Some tips to match your editing with your story.</h2>
<p>First, of course, you must know what your story is. In the e-book <em>In Life and Dreams: Envision Your Storybook Life</em>, I remember she strongly suggested to us to be able to give a short title to your image before, during and after shooting. No title? Hmmm, maybe you have no story or your story is unclear? Think about it.</p>
<p>Got a clear story? Great!</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the white balance slider locally or globally.
<ul>
<li>Do you want to showcase the night or evening time? Play with the Temperature White Balance slider, globally or locally, to add some blue where you want to enhance the night/evening time and add some yellow where you want to show daylight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bump or decrease the vibrance or the saturation.
<ul>
<li>For a happy picture, use vibrance. For a timeless story, desaturate it a bit, or a lot!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open or close those shadows.
<ul>
<li>You want to showcase the environment? Try opening the shadows. Or if you want to minimize them, keep them relatively closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go wild with the clarity slider or go soft.
<ul>
<li>If you want to add textures, try adding clarity. If you would like to convey a peaceful mood, decrease the clarity to -5 or more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/how-to-use-the-hsl-panel-in-adobe-lightroom-tutorial-by-jennifer-dell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use the HSL panel </a>
<ul>
<li>To add warmer or cooler tones using the hue sliders.</li>
<li>Get rid of a color that distracts the viewer from the story or enhance a color that contributes to your story, using the saturation slider.</li>
<li>To add richer tones or brighten others, using the luminance slider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the Camera Calibration Panel to tweak the colors more
<ul>
<li>Use the red or green slider to modify the greens in your image.</li>
<li>Use the blue saturation slider to add warmth without messing with skin tones or reducing it to reduce the overall saturation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you want a clean look and not a matte or hazy one, be sure that your histogram covers all the chart, so that you have the complete palette of light (shadows, midtones and highlights). And be sure you have not clipped shadows or blown highlights!</p>

			<p>At the beginning of my journey as a photographer, I watched a lot of tutorials and read plenty of articles saying DO NOT TOUCH THE CLARITY SLIDER. Instead, most publications recommended using the Sharpening slider.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Personally, I now use both. At the same time. With success.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, but at least give it a try!</p>
<p>That being said, the clarity slider won&#8217;t work with all your images.</p>
<div style="display: none;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55780" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1.jpg" alt="At the beginning of my journey as a photographer, I watched a lot of tutorials and read plenty of articles saying DO NOT TOUCH THE CLARITY SLIDER." width="736" height="1486" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1.jpg 736w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1-208x420.jpg 208w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1-416x840.jpg 416w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1-200x404.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1-400x808.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-use-the-clarity-slider-in-Lightroom-1-600x1211.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></div>
<h2>DO use the clarity slider for&#8230;</h2>
<ul>
<li>natural textures already present in your image (grass, foliage, clothes, clouds, leaves, sand, wood, etc.)</li>
<li>environmental portrait (small face in your big picture)</li>
<li>semi-silhouette or silhouette pictures</li>
</ul>
<h2>DON&#8217;T use the clarity slider with&#8230;</h2>
<ul>
<li>pretty bokeh (but sometime it can surprise you and work).</li>
<li>Close up portraits of faces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>DO (with caution)&#8230;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Human subject in a landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s do this.</p>

<p>Here is an image that I know will work with a lot of clarity. When I say a lot, I don&#8217;t mean 15, I mean between 30 and 60 and sometimes 100! And I promise, my faces always end up looking good.</p>
<p>So, in this picture, my son and his friend are relatively small in the frame and their faces are tiny. There are textures everywhere: the sky, the bay, the sand and on their clothes.</p>
<p>The first thing I do is analyze the histogram. I&#8217;ll want my histogram to reach both ends of the spectrum. Here, I&#8217;ll probably need to darken my blacks and watch for my highlights near the sun. I am happy with my exposure overall.</p>
<p>Then I start editing. I begin by pushing my highlights and my shadows to the extremes. Why? Because the clarity slider works really well with these settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights : -100</li>
<li>Shadows : +100</li>
</ul>
<p>I push the vibrance to 20 to begin and the clarity slider to 100. I then make my way down with the clarity slider. My goal is to reach the maximum clarity I can without compromising my son&#8217;s skin and the overall natural look of my picture.</p>
<p>As clarity often turns the image grey, it&#8217;s important to play with vibrance and saturation simultaneously. This is an important aspect of editing using the clarity slider. If you only do things in sequence, you will often end up with a clarity setting that is not all it could be. Try to keep the image appealing as you are trying different clarity values.</p>
<p>Clarity also increases contrast so you have to monitor your histogram for any loss of details. If needed, just modify the appropriate slider or use a brush to get them back if the problem is localized.</p>
<p>In my image, I need more blacks to get my histogram correctly balanced again but I will do it with the dehaze slider later. I also need to decrease the whites because they were clipped.</p>
<p>When my clarity slider is finally set, I do a last pass on the highlight and shadow sliders to really optimize contrast.</p>
<p>As you can see here, I ended up at clarity 100.</p>

<p>Now that the Basic Panel is done, I go on and tweak the other panels&#8230; all of them! One of my favorite is the Camera Calibration one, but that is another story for another day.</p>
<h2>The Detail Panel:</h2>
<p>The one you should be interested in is the Detail Panel. I mentioned previously that I use both clarity and sharpening sliders and I promised that my faces still look great.</p>
<p>Here is a before and after of my son and you can see my values for yourselves.</p>

<p>I know, skin-tones are ugly, but it will be corrected later.</p>
<p>First, I have a look at my ISO setting (400) and check for grain on his face.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noise Reduction: around 20 is my starting point. I rarely go over 30 but it happens occasionally.</li>
<li>Sharpening: I will stay around 40 (lots of grain) or 50-60.</li>
<li>Radius: between 1,1 and 3! If I used a lot of clarity, as in this picture, I will stay low. The key is to play with the &#8220;masking&#8221; by sharpening only the contour of what I want to have sharp (my son). I don&#8217;t want to sharpen his skin tough. To see what you are sharpening, click &#8220;alt-click&#8221; and move your slider. I only want the contour of his face to be outlined.</li>
</ul>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2022-01-07-Blog-Banner.jpg" title="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" alt="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" /></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s it&#8230; or almost. I go into Photoshop to do my cloning because I don&#8217;t like to do it in LR, it slows me down. I also correct my skin-tones there and tweak white balance!</p>
<p>Here is the before and after image in Lightroom, before pulling it into Photoshop.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget!</strong> If your subject is bigger in the frame and starts looking unnatural when using the clarity slider, you can put a radial filter over him and decrease the clarity. Some images just don&#8217;t like it. I always try, but some images will stay at a small clarity level, between 0-15.</p>
<p>Here are other examples where I went crazy with the clarity slider.</p>
