			<h2>Use the gear you have</h2>
<p>It can be tempting to run out and buy a new underwater camera or a pricey housing for your DSLR. However, I would urge you to use what you have before you dive into a bunch of new specialty purchases.</p>
<p>You can get some amazing shots of the kids jumping and splashing without having to actually get in the water. See how you can capture to story from the edge of the pool first. There are endless ways to illustrate the fun of the pool with the camera you have now.</p>

			<h2>Look from above</h2>
<p>I love to swim. But my kids can definitely out-swim me and I find myself on dry land as a supervisor a lot of the time. This is a great time to get those awesome overhead shots as you stay nice and dry by the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>Since your subjects are most likely moving all around the pool, you should do the same! Try standing on the diving board. Lean over the side. You could even stand on pool chair for an even higher perspective (but be careful!).</p>
<p>A bonus of shooting from above at the pool is that it is a great way to block out any unwanted distractions. Your viewer will never know that the pool was full of a bunch of rowdy tweens and pool toys or that the mismatched pool chairs were in major need of replacement.</p>

			<h2>Stay on dry land</h2>
<p>Just because we’re at the pool, there is still a lot that is happening on dry land! So many fun memories are made during days at the pool and many of them don’t even include water.</p>
<p>Look for stories to tell, interesting lines and shapes, and try pushing the water aside as a secondary character. Telling the story of days at the pool without actually focusing on the pool itself can be a fun unique challenge.</p>

			<h2>Get underwater</h2>
<p>While you can capture all the fun of the pool on dry land, an underwater perspective is definitely a lot of fun. If you have the gear to give it a try, dive right in!</p>
<p>I am admittedly a novice when it comes to shooting below the surface. But you don’t need to spend months studying the techniques, researching the gear, or watching post-processing videos. I have found that just experimenting has led to some magical results.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to break the bank if you want to give underwater photography a try. There are some really great, inexpensive options when it comes to underwater gear.</p>

			<p>As we don’t even own a pool, I couldn’t see spending $1,000+ on underwater housing. I chose a small underwater camera that gives me some control over exposure without being fully manual. It shoots in RAW and has a burst mode option. These high-end camera features that are important to me as they help me have more success when shooting and editing.</p>
<p>Even more important, my underwater camera is <i>tough</i>. It can withstand being tossed around in the pool bag, accidental drops, and any other mishaps that might happen poolside.</p>
<p>Another affordable option is buying a waterproof case for your smart phone. I’ve seen some really amazing underwater images taken with nothing more than an iPhone!</p>
<p>No matter what camera you are using, you are going to want to shoot <i>a lot</i> when you are shooting underwater. Most of my underwater photos are misses. This is a challenging environment in which to work and in order to get the shots that I love, I have to overshoot a bit. This isn’t the time to slow down!.</p>
<p>I also urge you to embrace images that are not technically perfect. Just like it will take a lot of shots to get one you love, the perfect moments might have a few flaws. Grain and a bit of blur are just part of the charm of underwater photography.</p>

			<h2>Use the diving board</h2>
<p>Does it get more quintessential than the diving board?! You’re missing out if you’re not capturing all the different movements and emotions that go with jumping off of the diving board.</p>
<p>The great thing about this is that you can capture this in or out of the water, with underwater gear or your regular camera. Get every angle you can: far away, close up, focusing on feet in the air, capturing the details of the water splashing.</p>
<p>Watch for little moments and movements that help show what the jumper is feeling. Excitement, fear, trepidation? Don’t forget to start shooting before the jump, as well. Sometimes the few steps up onto the diving board are the most memorable.</p>
<p>But not every jump is off the diving board and don’t forget to capture those as well. They’re just as much fun and can sometimes help simplify your photos by focusing just on the water and the jumper themselves.</p>

			<h2>Capture the journey</h2>
<p>How do you get to the pool? Do you pile up in the car, floaties and goggles on? Do you ride your bikes? Whatever the method, make sure to not let those stories be forgotten.</p>
<p>We walk across the street to our neighbor’s house and some of those images are my favorite and the most sentimental to me. I can see the progress of my boys graduating from training wheels to big boy bikes. I love to play with the scale of how little they are when they’re crossing the street.</p>
<p>Look for the little details of your trip to the pool that will change over time. Documenting those will tell the story of your family’s pool adventures more clearly.</p>

			<h2>Get brave</h2>
<p>If you don’t have housing or underwater gear, and if you’re brave enough, try standing in the shallow end of the pool with your camera. You can really capture some great photos this way!</p>
<p>Whenever I do this, I ALWAYS let everyone know that I’m going to be in the pool with my camera and that they are, under not circumstances, allowed to jump or splash near me. I usually don’t stay in very long if my camera is unprotected.</p>

			<p>So let’s kick off this season of pool fun by capturing it in photos! And be sure to have fun behind the camera, too.</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much about getting the “perfect shot.” While your kiddos are young, make sure you jump in and enjoy the moment with them.</p>
<p>If you don’t feel like you have captured anything noteworthy on one of your pool trips, don’t fret! Set the camera down, relax on a raft and try, try again the next day. It’s just another good excuse to head back to the pool tomorrow!</p>

			<p>Y’all, this dog. Our Vizsla is the absolute worst, best dog ever.  She barks and chases strangers. She eats food off the counter when we’re not looking. She poops in the house if you leave her alone for more than three minutes. She sits pretty in her pen until our car pulls out of the driveway and then she digs like a mad woman to escape. But we can’t live without her. She cuddles like a newborn baby, she greets you at the door like she hasn’t seen you in a decade and we love her fiercely.</p>

			<p>I picked up <a href="https://amzn.to/2OwAtvY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this little camera</a> about a year ago, wanting something that would be a little more portable than my Nikon set-up. Wow, did I ever fall in love. This little guy is just as powerful as my Nikon and even has a few extra features that I didn’t know I was missing out on before. It goes everywhere with me (it stays in my purse) so I never miss out when the mood strikes to take a pretty picture.</p>

It can hold my Nikon D610 along with my 50mm, 24-70mm, 70-200mm, and tons of accessories. It’s super comfortable and I don’t have to worry about anything falling out of my bag as I’m doing somersaults and barrel rolls on the ground trying to get THE shot.</p>

I print these every year and for each month, I have a photo from that month of the previous year. It’s so fun to be reminded of what we were doing exactly one year ago. It’s sad to say it, but the photos I put on this calendar are probably photos that would otherwise be buried deep on my hard drive, never to be seen again.</p>

It is strictly for mirrorless cameras and it is actually three lenses in one. You can twist the lens to switch from the Sweet, the Velvet and the Twist. If you twist halfway between two of the lenses, you can get a super cool double exposure effect. This is such a great tool to have if I am feeling in a rut or I want to get super creative.</p>

			<p>I don’t like to play favorites.</p>
<p>Really, I don’t.</p>
<p>The love I have for all the panels and filters and brushes in Lightroom is equal, just as the love I have for my children is equal. Except that’s a lie.</p>
<p>The radial filter has my heart, but my love is justified. This handy little tool can do all the things. All. The. Things. But let’s back up just a bit.</p>
<p>When I first began my journey in post processing, I learned the basics and I steadfastly stuck to them. There was no venturing off into the Effects Panel or dabbling in Split Toning.</p>
<p>However, it wasn&#8217;t long before I started to get a little curious about what all those other mysterious tools could do for my photos. They shouldn’t be that intimidating, right? It was then that I met my true love, the radial filter.</p>
<p>Lightroom’s radial filter can be found in the Develop module towards the top right of your screen. It’s indicated by a circle and it is found between the Adjustment Brush and the Graduated Filter.</p>
<p>To use the radial filter, make sure it is selected and then simply choose your effect. The great thing here is that you’re not limited to just one; select as many as you like.</p>
<p>Want to increase exposure and clarity? No problem!</p>
<p>Want to decrease your shadows but bring up the highlights a bit? You got it!</p>
<p>Next, go to your image and click and drag a circle or oval around the section where you are wanting the effects to take place. Keep in mind that you can place your effects inside the circle/oval or outside of it. To place your effects inside the circle, make sure to check the Invert Mask box.</p>
<p>When I first started experimenting with radial filters, I mainly used them to slightly darken the areas around my subject, and I still love it for this purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li>Radial Filter around my son.</li>
<li>Exposure -0.87</li>
<li>Shadows +100</li>
<li>(Even though I decreased the exposure in order to make my subject pop, I brought up the shadows to keep some of the detail in the branches of the trees.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is such a quick, easy and effective way to make your subject subtly pop.</p>
<p>When I use the radial filter, I almost always leave the Feather slider around 90-95 and drag my circle to be quite large. This just means that the effect you are applying will be heavily feathered and will subtly and gradually change.</p>
<p>Try adding a radial filter and taking the Feather slider all the way down to 0 and you will see what I mean.</p>

			<p>By making a large circle and keeping my feather up in the 90s, the desired effect will be much more natural looking and a lot less noticeable.</p>
<p>I used the radial filter to bring down exposure and shadows around my subject for a long time before I started getting creative and really pushing the limits to see what this one little tool can do for me. But once I started experimenting with it, I was blown away with the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>So without further ado, here are five ways to use the Radial Filter that will transform your images with just a few clicks.</strong></p>
<h2>1. To brighten eyes</h2>
<p>Yes, I know I can brighten eyes with the adjustment brush, and I do sometimes. But unless I am working on an extreme closeup, I tend to the like the results better using a radial filter.</p>
<p>You can use the Iris Enhance Effect with a radial filter, but sometimes simply lifting the shadows on each eye is sufficient. Like I mentioned before, I will keep the feather slider nearly all the way up and make my circles larger than my subjects eyes.</p>

<h2>2. To make my subject pop</h2>
<p>I had been using the radial filter for a long time with the intention of making my subject pop by deepening the background, but it took a while before I realized I could do this in reverse as well.</p>
<p>If my background is already the way I like it and I don’t want the shadows or exposure pulled down anymore, it’s time to get to work on my subject. I will frequently lift shadows, and sometimes exposure and clarity too, on my subject if they are caught in the shadows when shooting.</p>
<p>For this image of my son eating a s’more, the details I wanted to capture are lost, but with a few quick radial filters, the image is exactly the way I had it pictured in my mind.</p>

<h2>3. To make my background pop</h2>
<p>I do love to make my subject pop, don’t get me wrong. But sometimes a background just begs to be seen and my radial filters are there to help me make sure that happens.</p>
<p>In this image, I loved the texture and color in the reflection on the water, and I really wanted that to be the focus of the image. However, adding a ton of clarity and saturation to the entire image didn’t appeal to me because I wanted to keep the integrity of my son’s skin tones and softness intact.</p>
<p>Radial filter to the rescue!</p>

<p>Here’ s another image where I really wanted to play up the fun and whimsical vibe of the background, but didn’t want to ruin my sons’ bodies with a bunch of adjustments that I wouldn’t normally use on them.</p>
<p>The radial filter was perfect to keep them nice and clean while getting a little dramatic with their surroundings.</p>

<h2>4. To selectively change white balance</h2>
<p>White balance can sometimes be the bane of my existence. I hope I’m not the only one. It’s even worse when it’s not consistent throughout the frame. Enter the radial filter.</p>
<p>In this particular image, there were two types of light coming in from two different windows with varying warmth. If I warmed up the entire image, my son would be much too yellow. A quick radial filter on the window to the left allowed me to selectively warm up the white balance in that section of the frame as much as I needed to in order to balance out the image.</p>

<h2>5. To hide eyesores</h2>
<p>I’ll do anything to avoid pulling my images into Photoshop. Lightroom for life! But while the cloning tool in Lightroom is adequate, it’s not quite as capable as cloning in Photoshop (or in my case Photoshop Elements).</p>
<p>But I’ve found a way to get rid of eyesores and distractions in Lightroom while avoiding cloning altogether. Can you guess what it is? Yep! A radial filter.</p>
<p>If there is a distracting element in my frame that might be hiding in the shadows, a quick radial filter to lower shadows and sometimes even exposure or clarity will do the trick just fine.</p>

<h2>Everything and the kitchen sink</h2>
<p>Sometimes I just want to let loose and go crazy. In life and with my photos. On those days, one radial filter will just not do.</p>
<p>With photos that have a lot of texture and mystery, I like to add many radial filters to adjust different things in different parts of the frame. It’s fun for me to get creative and bump up clarity in certain sections while bringing down highlights somewhere else.</p>
<p>Or maybe I want to really saturate one small section of the frame while bumping up contrast in a different area. This little tool is so handy in helping me bring my artistic vision for a photo to life.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t suggest going this wild on all your photos, but you will know when you come across a photo that will be able to stand up to all the filters you throw it’s way.</p>

<p>In almost all of the instances we’ve talked about here, it’s important to reiterate that I almost always keep the Feather slider around 95 and I drag my circles rather large to keep the effect subtle.</p>
<p>However, there are a few times I will bring the feather slider down in the teens, and that is usually if I’m wanting to add the effect to something that is oval or circular in shape and I need the results to be drastic.</p>
<p>For example, it could be an image shot from above of my son drinking hot cocoa with a heaping amount of marshmallows. I could throw a radial filter on the top of that mug of coffee, bring the feather all the way down and lift the shadows and add all the clarity I want.</p>
<p>The more you play around with this handy little tool, the more you will be able to recognize when and where it will be able to help you achieve your artistic vision.</p>
<p>Now, I’m an old-school, Lightroom 5 kinda gal, but if you are using the Adobe Creative Cloud version of Lightroom, your radial filter has even more options.</p>
<p>After applying your circle, you have the option of masking on even more of the desired effect outside of your circle, and you are also able to erase portions of it inside of your circle. If you have this feature and you love it, don’t tell me about it. I’m clinging to my beloved Lightroom 5 for as long as I can.</p>
<p>So as you move forward with your post-processing adventures, don’t leave the sweet, unassuming radial filter out of your bag of tricks. We covered five ways this tool can transform your images, but if I know my little radial filter, when it comes to it’s capabilities, we’ve barely reached the tip of the iceberg.</p>

			<p>“Only boring people get bored.”</p>
<p>My whole life I’ve been afraid of being bored (or boring for that matter) because of these words. My mom’s response anytime my sister or I would whine the dreaded phrase, “I’M BOOOORED!”</p>
<p>So when I started my 365 project at the beginning of this year, that’s the one thing I wanted to accomplish: to take at least one photo a day that wasn’t boring to me. The last part of that sentence is very important. “To me.”</p>
<p>Not every photo is going to please every person. What’s boring to me, may be exceptional to you. A photo that’s exciting to me, may put you to sleep just by looking at it. I constantly need to remind myself of that. So in my daily shooting journey this year, I’ve discovered a few tricks that have helped me accomplish my goal.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve taken plenty of boring&#8230; ahem&#8230; uninteresting, photos this year, and I’m actually going to share those with you, too! Because when I take those types of shots, it helps me reassess and think through what I need to do to get a shot that I’m happy with. I know I’ll eventually find it. That one angle, that one detail or that new perspective I’ve never seen before. Those are the things that make my heart sing and that make me want to pick up my camera again and again. So here you go! Five tips to help kick BORING to the curb!!</p>
<h2>1. Emotion, humor</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. And this might also be why I never seem to like the traditional portraits I take of my kids. When I can add an element of emotion (and for me, nine times out of ten that emotion is humor) to an image, it is immediately transformed from what might otherwise be a boring photo.</p>
<p>My kids (and I’m sure most of yours, too) are just naturally funny. I try to pay close attention to what they’re doing and I can usually gauge when they’re going to do something that will elicit lots of emotion.</p>
<p>But every now and then, I will “set up” a situation where I know they won’t be able to resist big laughs. I once had a burp contest with my five year old while taking pictures. I almost puked (literally) but the genuine emotion and laughs I was able to capture of him are so special to me!</p>

Also, moving him to the bed of the truck and closer to the source of light (the sun outside) helped me eliminate distractions in the garage (I did also bring down the shadows a bit in post processing). With the distractions gone, the only focus is his precious emotion!</figcaption></figure><br />

<h2>2. Perspective</h2>
<p>If I shot every image the same way (for example, squatted down and straight in front of my subject) I would be bored to tears and over photography in just a few days. Trying to find a new way to shoot something that is not in and of itself interesting is a fun challenge for me.</p>
<p>I try to find things to shoot through, I’ll stand on things, put my camera on the ground, etc. It doesn’t always work, but usually if I keep trying, I’ll find something refreshing!</p>

<h2>3. Mystery in the details</h2>
<p>I love a little bit of mystery in my photos. I add an element of mystery to my photos by including just a few details of the story and letting the viewer fill in the pieces. Most of the time, I try to keep this in mind while I’m shooting, but sometimes I’ll achieve this in post processing by cropping to help tell my story.</p>
<p>If I look back at the photos I’ve taken this year, I would say nearly 80% of them don’t include my kids faces. Faceless images make me think so much more when I look at them. My mind is trying to fill in the blanks, and images that put my mind to work like that are some of my favorite.</p>

<h2>4. Silhouettes</h2>
<p>Oh, do I love a good silhouette. I love that they can be taken at pretty much anytime during the day and they can really enhance the action. Just make sure you are exposing for the sky and you will be good to go! Look for places, like a hill, or on top of a playground where your subject, and what they are doing, will really stand out. It’s always easier to eliminate distractions by adjusting your shooting angle than eliminate them in post processing (however, I’m not above a large clone job for a great silhouette!). Gorgeous clouds make for great silhouettes, but don’t be afraid to try them when the sky is a blank canvas too. Simplicity can be oh, so good!</p>

<h2>5. Flip it!</h2>
<p>I shoot a lot of reflections and shadows. And a lot of times they are more interesting to me after I’ve flipped then. The image becomes less about the person and new life is brought to the shadow/reflection itself. And how easy is this trick?!</p>
<p>The thing to remember is sometimes it can be really hard to tell if a flipped image is going to work until it is already flipped. So I flip LOTS of pictures (just a click of a button in LR) to find ones that work for me. I’m actually just going to call these before and after because the unflipped version isn’t necessarily boring. It’s just that the added element of flipping it really kicks it up a notch!</p>
