			<p>Recently a friend asked me for tips on shooting maternity sessions.</p>
<p>I started rattling off some ideas and decided to put them all in one spot.</p>
<p>Belly shots are some of my favorites for a lot of reasons. They have definitely gotten a bad rap over the years and we’ve all seen the ‘what not to do’ images on those funny websites, but really they can be so beautiful.</p>
<p>It’s a time of anticipation, change and excitement…all of which should be documented! How nice it is to have subjects take direction and it’s also a wonderful time to get to know new parents before you work with their precious newborn.</p>
<p>Family maternity sessions with other children (especially toddlers) are a whole other ball game… but these tips can apply too!</p>
<h2>Posing and Angles</h2>
<p>Flattering a mama and her pregnant belly should be high on your list of things to accomplish.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>There are all types of body types, which means there are countless ways women can carry a baby. What might look great for one mom could not work at all for another.</p>
<p>Here are some go to poses and angles for pregnant mommies (and daddies).</p>
<h3><strong>1.  Hands on the belly</strong></h3>
<p>It’s very natural for her to want to touch the bump! This is really effective in drawing attention to her belly and giving her a place to put those hands.</p>
<p>Mix it up as much as possible and try hands on the hips, in pockets or even touching her hair can work too.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

		<figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure">
			<div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="640" height="427" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_01.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" loading="lazy" title="leah_maternity_01" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_01.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_01-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h3><strong>2. Up high</strong></h3>
<p>If you can, stand on something or bring a stool to your session. Height is a great way to flatter your subject and a bigger belly.</p>
<p>Get creative! Have your subject(s) lie on a quilt or blanket so you can shoot from above. Getting up high can minimize parts of the body (other than the belly) that might have gotten bigger during pregnancy.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div  class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center">
		
		<figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure">
			<div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="640" height="427" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_02.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" loading="lazy" title="leah_maternity_02" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_02.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_02-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h3><strong>3. Keep it natural</strong></h3>
<p>When she looks down at her belly, make sure her head isn’t completely tilted at a weird angle… it can look unnatural and create a double chin. Have her fixate on a point slightly away from her bump.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Don’t forget eye contact and with a smile… everyone loves a classic shot like that. Vary expressions from laughter to more intense.</p>
<p>I love having the new dad stand off to the side or behind me (just like for a child session) and make silly jokes or dance. Good practice for what’s to come!</p>

	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h3><strong>4. Get couples close</strong></h3>
<p>A fun tip for couples is to ‘squeeze all the air out’ between them.</p>
<p>Have him touch her as much as possible (ummm keep it appropriate!). Try to get full body, half body and close ups of both of them together… even without the belly.</p>
<p>Basic couple posing can work well here, and if the belly gets in the way just go with it, usually it will make them (and you!) giggle.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div  class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center">
		
		<figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure">
			<div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="427" height="640" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_04.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" loading="lazy" title="leah_maternity_04" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_04.jpg 427w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_04-206x310.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h3><strong>5. Straight on</strong></h3>
<p>It really depends how ‘out there’ the bump is and what she’s wearing. If you can tell mama is pregnant with a straight on shot, make sure you get one.</p>
<p>Twisting to the side is obviously where it’s at for all pregnant moms, but she doesn’t have to be completely turned to the side, 45° angles can work well too.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div  class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center">
		
		<figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure">
			<div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="640" height="427" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_05.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" loading="lazy" title="leah_maternity_05" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_05.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leah_maternity_05-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h3><strong>6. Standing vs. sitting</strong></h3>
<p>Standing is almost always more flattering for pregnant women, but you still want your subject to be relaxed in their posing so tell her to bend a knee or pop a hip.</p>
<p>Sitting can be done though and I find it works the best when shooting a family or a couple together. Just be extra aware of your angles.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>One of the things to love about maternity images is the creativity they lend.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to play with your composition, color, angles, and breaking rules… especially if you are working with two adults that will take direction. Sometimes that is actually overwhelming and frustrating for me!!</p>
<p>When we shoot kids and babies we are forced to take their lead most times, so when we can actually stop for a moment and compose a more interesting shot it can be difficult to think on the spot. Slow down and even plan in your head before the session some new things you’d like to try or experiment with.</p>
<p>Photographing ‘just the bump’ has become the thing to do during belly sessions (guilty!) and while I think those shots can be fun, just make sure to include faces as well.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Emotion</h2>
<p>Talk with the mom or the expecting couple before hand about how awkward all of this might feel.</p>
<p>Most people feel so silly in front of a camera (I know I do!!) Reassure them it’s perfectly normal and a great warm up for future newborn pictures.</p>
<p>I have them focus on the emotions they’re experiencing and keep them in mind during their session. When they really start to anticipate the excitement of a new baby it can show in their faces and body language. Use all those hormones to your advantage!</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Lenses</h2>
<p>I truly believe that you could shoot a maternity session with ANY lens. I tend to use my 85mm and 35mm most of the time. Longer lenses can work really well too.</p>
<p>If you do pull out a super wide lens just be careful with the distortion, the last thing you need is for mom to look way bigger than she is. Wide angels can be really great for creativity and getting the whole picture.</p>
<p>This is a great time to use a Lensbaby, tilt shift or practice shooting wide open!</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The options are endless. With a first pregnancy you can really go anywhere! Urban, outdoors, a client’s home and you don’t have to worry about nap-time either!</p>
<p>This is a great time to use the sun for gorgeous backlighting (obviously my passion) or even head downtown since it will be almost impossible to do when the baby first arrives. Talk with the new mom about what they expect and want – bright colors and fun feel, more natural or a lifestyle session at home?</p>
<p>Don’t forget that you will have a mama that is starting to feel very uncomfortable. Please keep her health in mind by making sure you’re not making her walk a mile uphill or having her plop down on gravelly rocks!</p>

			<h2>Wardrobe</h2>
<p>What should I wear? This is the most asked question I get from expecting moms before their session and it’s a great one! I always tell them ‘don’t hide the bump… we need to see it, that’s the point!’</p>
<p>I also give them the option of two looks and even have them bring clothes and I’ll help them pick. Keep in mind a spot to have them change since it’s a lot harder to manage a bump in a tight space!</p>
<p>Clothes that cling are usually your best bet and more flattering. If mom wears a flowy dress you can make it work, but you’ll probably need her to gather and hold it close under the belly for defined belly shots or try facing her into the wind if you have some.</p>
<p>Clothing can also depend on the location and type of session. If you’re somewhere urban then maybe boots and bright colors are in order. More natural and you might have her opt for neutral tones and casual apparel.</p>
<p>This is a fun time to accessorize with jewelry, scarves or fun shoes because once she has the baby, fashion might not be high on the agenda. Have the new dad compliment her in his attire, much like you would in a regular family or couple session, just not too matchy-matchy.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>When</h2>
<p>When should maternity sessions take place? Again we want to ‘see the bump’ so this might depend on whether or not it’s a first pregnancy.</p>
<p>I typically recommend the beginning of the last trimester and hopefully before 35 weeks. Once they reach that point, things start to get uncomfortable &#8211; getting up and down is tough work and it’s hard to feel ‘pretty’.</p>
<p>If you’ve been pregnant in the past, try to think back and remember. If you do the session too early in the pregnancy you might not be able to tell there is a bump which makes it sort of difficult, since this is the point!</p>
<p>The best thing to do is communicate with each other and decide when the time is right. Also make sure there are no complications like risk of preterm delivery, physical limitations, possibility of bed rest or the mom is expecting multiples (and if that were the case you would probably need to schedule her session in the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester).</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Family maternity sessions can be so amazing but also really tricky. If the older sibling(s) are still very young, it can be stressful to get them in the shot and have mom show off her belly.</p>
<p>Remember mom doesn’t need to be chasing them all over so that leaves you and dad to help wrangle. Keep it light and fun. Try to get some ‘classic’ shots like you normally would, but do your best to focus on the interaction between family members.</p>
<p>Talk up being a BIG sister or brother. Posing and direction take on a life of their own when you add kids into the mix. Just remember to keep the bump present and try to flatter mom as much as possible.</p>
<p>Pets can be a great addition to maternity pictures. I’ve met so many couples that want to include their fur babies. Choose your location wisely when working with animals.</p>

			<h2>Props</h2>
<p>I’ve never been a huge prop person, but they can be really popular in maternity sessions. Sometimes (in my opinion) there is a fine line between something that is cute and something that is overly cheesy.</p>
<p>Be upfront with your clients about what your style is by linking them to previous maternity sessions. If the new mom does want to incorporate a prop or idea they’ve seen on Pinterest into their session, pick and choose. Do your best to complete their vision but remember it’s okay to put your own spin on it.</p>
<p>Communicating up front is very important here!</p>

<p>Setting up the camera, using a timer and remote or even the bathroom mirror are all ways you can snap some shots. Or how about your own belly view!?</p>
<p>Don’t forget to schedule a session with *another* photographer to have images with your family!</p>

			<p>So there ya have it… some ways to improve your belly pictures.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most new parents would rather not have a million+1 maternity images which is why it’s a great idea to tailor your packages and pricing accordingly. Currently I have mini maternity sessions as an option when they are attached to a full newborn shoot.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to build your portfolio, you might offer a complimentary mini maternity session when clients book their newborn or jump at the chance to snap some pics of your expecting bestie (makes for a great baby gift!)</p>
<p>And for fun, here&#8217;s me at 27 weeks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the New Year approaches many of us start to think about resolutions, goals and areas we’d like to make changes to in our personal lives.  Let’s take that one step further and relate them to our photography!  The key (or so I’m told) to keeping resolutions is to be as specific as possible and pin point the exact spots you’re looking to improve.  This list is expansive and even a bit overwhelming.  At some point we have to realize that we can’t do it all in a matter of months, but with small changes, hard work and a focus on our goals, we can keep resolutions that WILL make us better photographers and possibly people!</p>
<p>Below is a list of 10 popular New Year’s resolutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diet and Exercise Plan</li>
<li>Budget and Reduce Debt</li>
<li>Spend More Time with Family and Friends</li>
<li>Be Happier and Healthier</li>
<li>Travel More</li>
<li>Break Bad Habits</li>
<li>Pursue Higher Education</li>
<li>Give to Others</li>
<li>Get Organized</li>
<li>Be More Spontaneous</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16423" title="photography resolutions for the new year by Leah Cook" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_01.jpg" alt="photography resolutions for the new year by Leah Cook" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_01.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_01-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>How do these have anything to do with our love of photography?  Funny you should ask…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16424" title="setting and keeping your photography resolutions" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_02.jpg" alt="setting and keeping your photography resolutions" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_02.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_02-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Diet and Exercise</h4>
<p>Diet.  Not a word we love to hear!!  Diet is all about selection.  Just like in a healthy food plan, you make choices in your photography everyday.  What lenses you shoot with, how many sessions you choose to take on or even using the basic gear you do have to make a certain shot ‘work’.  Diet can also be looked at as in moderation.  Are you obsessed?  It’s okay, you can admit it!  Maybe it’s time to take a step back and use your photography in moderation or for a more specific purpose.  It’s not healthy for something to rule or consume your life (like food…or even picture-taking!)  Balance is key.  Don’t worry, I’m not talking about giving up!  Which actually leads me to exercise.  Getting regular physical exercise is a goal many of us strive to make time for in our everyday life.  Giving your camera a workout is just as important.  I don’t even want to know the shutter count on my cameras!  You will only improve if you practice and USE it.  Can you <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/shooting-daily-getting-started-and-pushing-through-a-365-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commit to daily shooting</a>?  How about the weekends?  If you want to improve and be a stronger photographer, this simply has to happen.  Personally I used to get frustrated with the work I was producing and it only discouraged me, not motivated me…so I stopped shooting all together.  I would go periods of time with just giving my camera a dirty look.  Or instead of actually taking pictures of my family and things that were personal to me, I only did if for everyone else.  How sad!!  My Camera was NOT the problem, but my lack of discipline to put in the hard work and practice what I was learning was.  Just like jogging everyday takes will power and self-determination, so does shooting.  Don’t let your camera collect dust!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>be selective in your gear</li>
<li>use what you have</li>
<li>limit sessions if you’re a professional</li>
<li>commit to a 365 or project 52</li>
<li>post weekly on your blog</li>
<li>participate in a blog circle with fellow photographers</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16425" title="typical new years resolutions and how they pertain to photography" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_03.jpg" alt="typical new years resolutions and how they pertain to photography" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_03.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_03-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Budget</h4>
<p>Money…we have a love-hate relationship.  It makes the world go ‘round…and gives us major headaches at the same time!  Lots of families vow to get out of debt and start spending smartly in the New Year.  Most of us also have a budget when it comes to photography.  We all know this is not a cheap hobby or profession!  Do your best to separate your photography budget from your family finances.  It can only lead to resentment if you’re trying to save for a new lens and pay for a trip to Disney World out of the same account.  Create a plan of action and have a timeline, even if you’re not in business mark those specific dates on the calendar.  Before you make any major gear upgrade decisions, rent lenses or the camera of your dreams to make sure it’s really what you expect.  Or if you’re lucky enough to shoot with friends and swap equipment to practice with, I’d highly recommend it.  This is how I broke down and acquired my 35mm 1.4L (thanks a lot, <em>Sara Seeton</em>!)  If you are in business, make it a point to sit down and get your plan and taxes in order.  You need to be getting paid what you’re worth!  Remember your time is valuable &#8211; don’t give it away for free.  What vendors will you be using this year, what are your cost of goods and also evaluate programs to keep up your finances?  Will you re-brand with a new logo or blog design?  Don’t forget to leave room for extras that you’ll just HAVE to have down the road…that cute Valentine’s Day card template, a gorgeous newborn headband or a fabulous <a href="http://store.clickandcompany.com/elearning/?sort=newest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakout session in the CMstore</a>!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>rent or borrow gear before purchasing</li>
<li>buy refurbished products and look for special savings (ask around)</li>
<li>mark buy dates on the calendar</li>
<li>re-visit your session pricing for the new year</li>
<li>work with what you have</li>
<li>shop clearance sections, garage sales or flea markets for props</li>
<li>leave room for unexpected extras – actions, software, etc.</li>
<li>make sure taxes are in order</li>

<h4>Family and Friends</h4>
<p>This is what we live for right, who we want to be with, and time and time again, we push them aside &#8211; we are too busy with editing, with laundry, with whatever.  Everyone struggles to <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/balancing-family-life-with-your-photography-business-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a balance in their lives</a>, especially parents.  We have so many chores and so often we over commit ourselves, leaving us with less time than ever to spend with our loved ones.  Let’s all vow to make it better!  We can still have a photography business or extensive hobby while keeping our focus on those that matter most.  Use photography to be with your family!  Like I mentioned earlier – it can either take over and consume you or you can use it to actually spend time with your kids.  That’s one benefit of the 365 that I loved…it was time with my boys each and every day!  They even started to look forward to when I would snap their picture.  Also, look for the value of online friendships.  Really, before I was a ‘photographer’ I didn’t get it.  How can you be close to someone that you never see or is 4,000 miles away?  Now I’m a believer – I have made life long friends, not just connections, through this photography community.  We have a commonality and get each other – we’ve all been through the same things (or will go through them at some point.)  It’s nice to chat with my girls online and not have to explain the late hours, stress and ‘too much magenta’ in the skin tones I’m working on.  But that being said, in no way should you abandon those friends that got you where you are today.  The ones that know you better than you know yourself – believe me, I have some friends in my life that will always be a part of me.  However, friendships can be tricky when it comes to photography.  Hopefully those that know and love you best will choose not to take advantage of your time and talents.  Remember to set boundaries and make sure they honor session fees and schedules.  It’s beyond hard to explain how long it takes to edit images or the hours we spend in front of the computer answering emails or perfecting our craft.  But please, if someone has no regard for your time – speak up!  It will only make things more difficult in the long run if you agree to take pictures and you’re already at your commitment level.</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>create office hours</li>
<li>take pictures of your own kids (include yourself in some too!)</li>
<li>have some session-free weekends to spend with loved ones</li>
<li>consider occasionally hiring a babysitter or professional house cleaner</li>
<li>discover CM and online photography friendships</li>
<li>join local photography groups</li>
<li>have special friend rates</li>
<li>barter and trade with friends (but make it worth your time!)</li>
<li>hire a photographer to take YOUR family pictures</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16427" title="friends and family and photography" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_05.jpg" alt="friends and family and photography" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_05.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_05-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Healthy and Happy</h4>
<p>First of all, taking pictures can contribute to our physical health especially if you are chasing a toddler, sweating at a newborn session or lugging camera gear out to a gorgeous field in the heat of the summer.  But it can also really affect your mental health.  The more positive and realistic we are about our work, the more we can learn, grow and feel satisfied about where we are in our photographic journey or business.  So how do we do that?  It’s one thing to just say ‘oh I’m happy where I am’ and it’s another thing to really believe it.  We are social people – we need interaction and approval.  Once we begin to receive (and give) positive reinforcement, we really do start to feel better about our images.  This doesn’t mean that everyone will like what you produce.  Guess what – they don’t have to!  But lots of people will appreciate where you’re coming from.  Share your work with others – and I’m not just talking about your bestie or your mom because they will obviously love it!  Show other photographers online, either for critique or just in general.  Embrace the positive responses and learn from constructive criticism.  Ask for help if you can’t figure it out and for your well-being, try so very hard not to compare yourself to others.  I struggle with this all the time and happen to know some extremely talented photographers that do as well (you’d be surprised!).  We are only human.  Keep telling yourself that the photographer you most admired had to start somewhere exactly like you!  Photography can be very fulfilling, especially when we find our groove and style, but it never really ends – it’s always evolving.  Whether you’re in business or a hobbyist, being proud of your work really takes time…maybe this is your year!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>have a positive attitude about your work</li>
<li>ACCEPT constructive criticism and positive reinforcement</li>
<li>GIVE constructive criticism and positive reinforcement</li>
<li>try not to compare yourself to others</li>
<li>ask for help</li>
<li>have patience in your journey</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/creative-wall-displays-get-those-photos-off-your-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">print images for your home</a></li>
<li>save for a workshop or new lens</li>
<li>work to <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmpro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for CMpro</a></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16428 aligncenter" title="staying healthy for your new years resolution" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_06.jpg" alt="staying healthy for your new years resolution" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_06.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_06-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Travel</h4>
<p>Well, I’m sure we would all LOVE to see the other side of the world and if you’re able to jet-set then more power to you, just don’t forget the camera!  Locally speaking, plan day trips and excursions around the corner in your city or near by places (or states) you’d like to visit.  Relating to business – get your name out there!  Talk to small boutiques or doctors’ offices about working with you in the future…share cards and samples.  Also, the more you travel, the more session spots you’ll pick up along the way – keep your eyes peeled for awesome and unique locations!  Make a plan at the beginning of the year with other photography friends or your kids.  Consider participating in <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/clickinwalk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickin Walk</a>!  You don’t have to take your entire bag, a lens or two will do but you’ll be surprised how inspirational a small getaway and change of scenery can be!  Take pictures of your kiddos experiencing new things – the zoo, an ice cream cone or snap some headshots of your local photog buddy – just change out of your yoga pants and leave the house, by golly!  And try not to be embarrassed when you show off that fabulous DSLR in public – let them drool (or tell you that your camera must take REALLY great pictures…)</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>make a list of where you want to travel</li>
<li>get your business name out there</li>
<li>search for new session locations</li>
<li>who will be joining you and plan accordingly</li>
<li>put those spots and dates on the calendar</li>
<li>think about time of year (i.e. Bluebonnets in Texas in the Spring)</li>
<li>consider what lenses to take – versatile zoom?  wide prime?</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16429 aligncenter" title="traveling and your photography business" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_07.jpg" alt="traveling and your photography business" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_07.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_07-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Bad Habits</h4>
<p>We all have personal habits that need to be broken, ahem, eating Cheetos at 2am, checking my iPhone every 2 seconds or enjoying a few glasses of wine (when I’m not preggers of course)  but relating this to photography can cover a whole dang lot of us.  Facebook anyone?  Although WONDERFUL for networking, business building and sharing images it really can suck us in.  Take some time to really evaluate how much facebook sees of you, when you might need that precious time to work (so you can spend it elsewhere like we talked about above).  Blog stalking is another one.  I don’t see anything wrong with paying a visit to your favorite blogs but it’s when we start to compare ourselves to photographers that have been at it way longer than we have or getting down on our work because we’re not as creative.  Look at their gorgeous eye candy, pin your favorites, leave some love (everyone loves love!) and move on; try something new after you’ve seen a new pose or setup that inspired you but do your best not to obsess.  And of course as photographers we always take on too many projects, say yes more than is humanly possible and exhaust ourselves to the point of burn out.  BAD.  We need to know and recognize our limits and ask for help (I might be talking directly to myself here…).  This can also relate to our shooting habits.  For example, getting in a rut with only choosing one lens when we have many more in the bag, always shooting at the same time of day, inside vs. outside or the worst offense &#8211; forgetting to snap shots of our family members and only doing it for others.  Remember why you started in the first place!  Then there’s a look at our bad technical habits.  Try not to get lazy about white balance, proper exposure, or not stepping back and looking for distractions in the frame before you snap.  Because really, all of those things just take up more time on the post processing end and we want to streamline!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>limit time on facebook and pinterest</li>
<li>make your time online count for something</li>
<li>remember to shoot for you and not just others</li>
<li>pick a day each week that you visit your favorite blogs</li>
<li>say NO and mean it</li>
<li>push yourself to break bad (or comfortable) shooting habits</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16430 aligncenter" title="stopping those bad photography habits" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_08.jpg" alt="stopping those bad photography habits" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_08.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_08-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Higher Education</h4>
<p>Wouldn’t it have been amazing to find this love when we were all in college?!  Think of the experience we’d have, the books we’d have acquired, the masters we would have learned from and the 8:00am economics class we could have skipped.  Yep, not so much.  I have no idea what the actual percentage of professional photographers or serious hobbyists that actually have a photography degree is but I’d bet it’s pretty low.  And guess what?  That’s okay – we are still photographers and we still have the right to take gorgeous pictures!  Don’t let anyone look down on you because you’re self taught and haven’t had formal training.  But here’s the deal, in order to get better at this complicated art you do need to constantly improve and grow.  There are many ways to do that and at all price points!  In person workshops are really invaluable.  Expensive?  Yes.  But worth it and if you budget for one starting a year in advance, then why not?  Hands on and small group experience is exceptional.  Make sure you read reviews, contact the instructor and former participants before you really make a commitment.  If that’s something that’s on a far away wish list then consider online courses.  Right here at <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickin Moms CMU</a> is packed full of informative workshops and breakout sessions for every skill level and interest, professional and hobbyist alike.  Learn business, natural lighting techniques, flash (studio and speedlight), lifestyle, basic shooting, composition, WordPress, post processing and even finding your style!  I’ve had the privilege to be a teaching assistant to several of them and am always impressed with the growth I see in students.  Not only are the instructors top notch (and sweet as they can be!) but truly they put 100% into the material and experience, they are there for you…as well as your peers.  I can’t recommend them enough.  One on one or group mentorships are a wonderful option as are tutorials found on the CM board.  Buy a <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/19-must-read-books-for-photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photography book</a> on a topic that interests you.  You’d be surprised at how much you’re inspired by just opening your mind to new information.  My biggest advice though – pace yourself.  Photography comes at its own speed and sometimes you really get it and things click extra quickly and other concepts really take their time to sink in.  Have patience that you’ll get there.  Take something away from every session, whether it’s a paid client or a creative shoot for your kids.  Learn from every picture you edit and you’ll get there…keep telling yourself, we ALL start somewhere.</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn something new this year (how to work your speedlight?)</li>
<li>sign up for a workshop – in person or online</li>
<li>mentoring</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>peer groups</li>
<li>books</li>
<li>spend some time with a new photographer and share your knowledge</li>
<li>continuing education for small business owners</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16431 aligncenter" title="continuing your photography education" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_09.jpg" alt="continuing your photography education" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_09.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_09-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Give</h4>
<p>Don’t we give enough?!  I mean, SURE, I’ll take the pictures for your friend’s cousin’s brother’s birthday party…and no problem, I don’t have plans on [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&#8221;yes&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&#8221;1_1&#8243; background_position=&#8221;left top&#8221; background_color=&#8221;&#8221; border_size=&#8221;&#8221; border_color=&#8221;&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; spacing=&#8221;yes&#8221; background_image=&#8221;&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;no-repeat&#8221; padding=&#8221;&#8221; margin_top=&#8221;0px&#8221; margin_bottom=&#8221;0px&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; id=&#8221;&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;0.3&#8243; animation_direction=&#8221;left&#8221; hide_on_mobile=&#8221;no&#8221; center_content=&#8221;no&#8221; min_height=&#8221;none&#8221;][said] holiday, so let’s get a session in.  Okay, I’m just being rude.  But really it does feel like we give our time and talents away a lot, right?  It’s true – remember as parents we do that as well.  But I’m talking about giving with no strings attached, no bitterness and out of the goodness of our hearts.  It’s really harder than it sounds.  As humans we want credit for our good deeds!  But try it sometime.  Find a charity you’re interested in and work something out to donate pictures.  Work with friends to find a family in need of pictures that can’t afford them and gift them a session just because.  My personal goal is to work with the animal shelter up the road – I had big plans to do that last year and it was totally my fault that it fell through.  If time is not an option (remember we are trying to be with our family and friends more) then create a tutorial and share with others, it doesn’t have to be major and a new photographer might really take something valuable away from your teaching.  Pay it forward with gear you don’t use anymore or a phone call to help someone just starting out (there’s a whole sub-forum to do that on CM!)  The key to giving is what I mentioned earlier – you’ve got to give and then let it go, especially if it’s donating a session to a charity auction, etc. but don’t expect to get something in return (except for feeling really happy in that huge heart of yours!).  And also, to not over commit.  We all do so much in general (volunteering at school or church, taking dinners to friends) and it doesn’t have to be a monumental achievement.  Small acts of kindness with your camera can go a long way!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>volunteer to take pictures of an after school activity</li>
<li>donate your time to a new photographer</li>
<li>give blankets or props you no longer use to those just starting out</li>
<li>volunteer with an organization working with families that face terminal illness</li>
<li>find families in need of family sessions</li>
<li>don’t over commit or expect gifts in return</li>
<li>apply to be an <a href="http://www.oplove.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">op love photographer</a></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16432 aligncenter" title="give back with your photography" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_10.jpg" alt="give back with your photography" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_10.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_10-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Organize</h4>
<p>Oh I’m not sure if I’m qualified to write this little blurb.  Procrastinating and organizing are two concepts I’ve struggled with my ENTIRE life.  The whole right brain fighting with the left brain thing.  I’ve tried and tried and tried.  And honestly, I have a few ‘systems’ that work out well but I’m going to take notes of my own notes here!  The options are ENDLESS when it comes to photography and organization.  This could be an entire article on it’s own!  With regards to your photography workflow, get it in order!  Especially with sessions – organize those first but what do you start with?  For me, it’s the classic portrait and then I move on from there.  Have a game plan and that will serve you well.  Post Processing – again, organize your workflow.  It took me a while to figure out how I liked to edit.  Now I have simple steps that I do to almost every image, both for clients and personal shots – whatever programs you choose to use, learn them (workshop!?) and feel comfortable with what you can accomplish.  Back it up!  Make sure you have external hard drives or online programs that back up your images to avoid data loss and have a plan put in place for actually using those safety nets!  After every session, I immediately load files on my computer (to make sure there wasn’t an issue with the cards) and then I back those RAW files up to CD or an external hard drive (EHD) for peace of mind.  PRINT YOUR PICTURES!!  As photographers we need to organize our printing procedure.  For one, we actually go through and look at the pictures we’ve taken.  Pick a day each month that you sort, edit and order your personal favorites – they don’t have to be on canvas or in custom designed albums (although that needs to go on the to do list) but just prints for now will do.  Start somewhere.  Obviously if you have a photography or any small business, organization is beyond important.  Have a plan for the new year – marketing efforts, take-home profit goal, updating your blog, client materials such as contracts and welcome packets, budget…see, endless!  Organize your desk workspace and the system you have for completing proofing and client orders.  Email.  It might as well be a four letter word!!  How does it pile up so quickly!?  I’ve resorted to an automated response which buys me a day or two before I reply with a personal follow up.  Pick a day of the month and purge your email.  Create specific folders for clients and craft basic replies that you can personalize to make better use of your time.  Online calendar!  This is something that I started doing not too long ago and it’s been wonderful – I use the one from Google and it connects directly to my iPhone as well.  Color code everything and share the calendar with those closest to you.  Put all these ‘supposed’ dates that we’ve discussed on your calendar too – and opt for reminders!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>workflow – session and post processing and client proofs</li>
<li>business plan</li>
<li>printing pictures – when and how</li>
<li>back up data</li>
<li>client materials</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>calendars – have a system that works for you and share it so everyone is on the same page</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-16433 aligncenter" title="keeping you and your photography business organized" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_11.jpg" alt="keeping you and your photography business organized" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_11.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resolutions_11-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Spontaneity</h4>
<p>Woo-hoo something that’s fun!  Well, unless you are a very scheduled, rule-following person!  It doesn’t have to be painful – really this is a time to unwind and actually *break* some rules.  Take your camera with you and if you can’t, get an olloclip for your iPhone or a cheap point and shoot (and don’t forget to print those either!).  Start to document your everyday in an artistic way and play around with composition, color, and light.  Remember what it was like when you were just starting out and couldn’t get enough of taking pictures…throw limb chops and white balance to the wind (shh don’t tell anyone I said that)!  This goal is about taking risks and chances or using a lens that you have in your bag and never take out.  Splurge on a lensbaby, fisheye, tilt-shift (yes please!) or macro.  Just because you shoot mostly people doesn’t mean you can’t see them in a different, more creative way.  Or if you’re used to using your macro on newborn baby toes, try it on that flower bush or spider web in your front yard.  What about using film or setting up a fun themed session!  Just push yourself, every once and awhile.  You can even slow down and try shooting in the dark!  Break out the tripod and set it up to capture the stars (or yourself)!  Really there are so many ways to step outside the box with photography – reignite your passion!</p>
<p>Specific Goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>take the camera and USE it</li>
<li>iPhone and olloclip</li>
<li>participate in CMglimpse on Instagram</li>
<li>be creative and focus on creating artful compositions</li>
<li>splurge on new gear</li>
<li>step outside your box and shoot new subject matter</li>
<li>read up on a new technique</li>
<li>shoot a themed session</li>
<li>try out film</li>
<li>self portraits</li>
</ol>
<p>So, wow…that seems like a lot of stuff we need to do!?  My goodness, I better get started ASAP.  Remember, if you can only pick a few resolutions and go with them, do it.  So many of these goals overlap so make sure to choose what is most important to you!  We are all on our own personal path but I for one feel connected to so many photographers out there.  It’s an amazing art form that ties many of us together, in both our personal and professional lives.  Happy New Year to all of you!!</p>
<p>What are your resolutions for the New Year?  We&#8217;d love to hear what you&#8217;ll be working on, whether it&#8217;s photography related or not![/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. I&#8217;ve made basic edits to this image in ACR including adjusting white balance, tweak exposure, and recover a bit of the white shirt.  After pulling it into Photoshop, I corrected some yellow-green color casts and that was it!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-11768 aligncenter" title="leah ps tutorial_01" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_01.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="640" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_01.jpg 427w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_01-206x310.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></p>
<p>2. Next I created a Selective Color layer and switched it to the neutrals box.  Here I&#8217;ve decreased the magenta to -2 which helps add a little warmth.  I haven&#8217;t touched the Cyan value, but that one can also be adjusted.</p>
<p>3. Then I created a Levels layer and found some &#8216;numbers&#8217; that worked to add the summery glow.  Aside from changing the output level to 40 in RGB, I&#8217;ve also used the pull down to select Red and Blue (Green did not change.)</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;ve decreased the opacity on the Levels layer to 80%</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-11769 aligncenter" title="leah ps tutorial_02" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_02.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="880" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_02.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_02-225x310.jpg 225w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_02-465x640.jpg 465w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>5. Deciding that the image needed a little pop, I&#8217;ve created a Brightness/Contrast layer: Brightness +2 and Contrast +10.</p>
<p>6. I&#8217;ve then lightly masked their beautiful faces to pull off some of the &#8220;glow&#8221; so that they still shine through.</p>
<p>7. Lastly, I create another layer and burn some of the edges to define the image, nothing drastic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-11770 aligncenter" title="leah ps tutorial_03" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_03.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1329" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_03.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_03-149x310.jpg 149w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/leah-ps-tutorial_03-308x640.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-11261 aligncenter" title="recommended Canon camera and lenses by Leah Cook" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek1_leah.jpg" alt="recommended Canon camera and lenses by Leah Cook" width="640" height="1607" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek1_leah.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek1_leah-123x310.jpg 123w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I shoot with a Canon 5D MarkII. I upgraded in 2009 from the 40D and love it. The lenses I take with me to all my sessions are:</p>
<p>1. 17-40 4.0L – a super wide angle great for getting the BIG picture…tough to use inside because of the narrower aperture</p>
<p>2. 24-70 2.8L – a versatile lens and especially useful for chasing moving toddlers…creates really fantastic lens flare</p>
<p>3. 35 1.4L – my current favorite and I’m not sure how I lived without it…perfect for inside and lifestyle sessions</p>
<p>4. 50 1.4 – my very first portrait lens and an extremely comfortable focal length…this is the one I’ll upgrade next</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adorama.com/CA85122AFU.html?KBID=66976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">85 1.2L</a> – this lens built my business…used it in every single session I’ve ever done</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adorama.com/CA10028AFN.html?KBID=66976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">100 2.8 macro</a> – pop this on and get creative…from eyelashes to petals, it gets me thinking outside the box</p>
<p>7. lensbaby composer – a gift from my dad, I’m thankful this is in my bag…it definitely needs to be used more</p>
<h4>miscellaneous stuff:</h4>
<p>430EX Speedlite – I’ve had this since my 40D and am still figuring out how to use it. comes in handy in an emergency lighting situation</p>
<p>extra battery pack and charger</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Memory-Holder-SDAC-13-MicroSD/dp/B00494XZ1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338339156&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SanDisk card holder</a></p>
<p>TONS of CF memory cards – too many to count…my favorites are 4GB + 8GB</p>
<p>business cards</p>
<p>remote</p>
<p>lens cleaning kit</p>
<p>sharpie (just in case)</p>
<p>iPhone 4</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/store/shop/olloclip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olloclip</a> for the iPhone</p>
<p>gum</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Beeswax-15-Ounce-Tubes/dp/B002DPUXZM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338339299&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chapstick</a></p>
<p>stickers for kids</p>
<p>lens puppet that my mom made – before they were cool</p>
<h4>bags:</h4>
<p>Mostly I use my LowePro roller bag because I carry almost all of my gear to sessions, it also fits in airplane compartments and turns into a backpack (but I never use that feature.) I’m in love with my <a href="http://kellymoorebag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Moore classic bag in purple</a>, it comes in handy on day trips and can double as a diaper bag.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-11262 aligncenter" title="office workspace of photographer Leah Cook" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek2_leah.jpg" alt="office workspace of photographer Leah Cook" width="640" height="1031" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek2_leah.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek2_leah-192x310.jpg 192w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/peek2_leah-397x640.jpg 397w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>my current workspace:</h4>
<p>Well, I’m gonna be real. My computer has been sitting on our table since the holidays…oh yes, you read right. But it’s worked for us…I’m where all the action is and we even pushed the table against the wall for more play-space and toys. This nook is situated in between the kitchen, living room, and playroom. I might not be able to get an entire session proofed during the day but it does make it easier to get smaller tasks accomplished. If we eat together as a family it’s in the living room or at the kids table!! My hubby created a fantastic space for me directly above this one but it’s not finished out yet…one day soon!</p>
<p>1. junk, papers, receipts, to-do lists, etc…lots of them right at my fingertips</p>
<p>2. 27 inch iMac &#8211; I love her more than words.</p>
<p>3. Sharpies (I’m addicted)</p>
<p>4. card reader</p>
<p>5. (2) Seagate GoFlex EHDs</p>
<p>6. stack of DVDs – for saving RAW files</p>
<p>7. iPhone (of course)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This might sound dramatic, but the <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmprodaily/" target="_blank">CMpro Daily Project</a> has changed my life!  For the better.  Oh, and it’s done wonders for my photography!  I can literally look back to the date I started shooting every. single. day and see little epiphanies here and there.  Not to mention, that I have a record of my baby boys’ growth and giggles (and sometimes tears.)  It’s something I’m really proud of…because it’s hard to commit to a project this overwhelming. I want to share with you my struggles, the joy, and a few tips that I’ve learned these last 8 months.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before but I could kick myself for not joining <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank">Clickin Moms</a> in the beginning of my photo journey, and I’m so incredibly thankful for this community of photographers.  Even just viewing images on the Daily Project has been eye opening…seeing new perspectives, watching how others use light and angles has been huge for me. Observing daily snippets from amazing artists really opens your eyes.  We all get stuck in our own photo rut – whether personal or professional, but when surrounded by creativity you just can’t help but be inspired.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10838 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-15.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-15.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-15-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Why do a 365</h4>
<p>I will admit that shooting daily is something I totally fell into.  <a href="http://saraseeton.com/" target="_blank">Sara Seeton</a> and I were chatting and she started telling me about the buzz surrounding the Daily Project…sadly I had been absent from <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmpro/" target="_blank">CMpro</a> and immediately hopped online and looked it all up.  Shooting everyday!!? No way…could I do that?  Why not!  In the beginning I tried too hard.  I put some unneeded pressure on myself to get that ‘perfect’ shot and then it just seemed like too much.  I kept thinking – why am I doing this?  Who is this for?  That’s something to ask yourself…not everyone has the opportunity to share their work publicly, but maybe that’s a good thing.  If you’re shooting for you, then it’s okay to keep it private.  But that’s not me…I like to share!  It’s a personal choice for sure.  Back to why…when I started it was to be a part of a project with photographers I looked up to and not wanting to give up or back out…but it quickly turned into something for my family.  For me!  I won’t lie – with the expectation that an image will be up everyday it’s kept me accountable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10826 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-03.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-03.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-03-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Make a List</h4>
<p>In the beginning it helps to have a list.  I honestly just took one. day. at. a. time.  I didn’t look forward to tomorrow or stress about yesterday’s image.  I had to focus on today – what are we doing?  What little things can I capture that I haven’t taken a picture yet?  Make a list of things you do as a family…or if this is another type of project – macro images, black/white conversions, or if you work daily…client shots!  Ask yourself what the big picture of this project is for you and then micro manage yourself.  It’s so helpful to have notes to come back to when you need an idea.  The great thing for me was that I started to take pictures inside our home. Which is TERRIBLY outdated. There are a couple rooms that I can handle, but mostly I have the ‘when can we change this’ bug…and taking pictures inside has helped me appreciate our home more and forced me to be creative as well.  I won’t bore you with a long list of ideas but think basic to start with: brushing teeth, eating, playing games, getting the mail, watching the iPad…build on those!  Even if you’ve been at this for awhile, it’s always great to go back and revisit something you’ve missed.  Also, don’t be afraid to overshoot in the beginning – I’m a chronic CF-card waster…go through those things like nothing but I have gotten better…my hard drive has made me!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10827 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-04.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-04.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-04-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Consider a Theme</h4>
<p>If it gets you started shooting daily, come up with a theme.  I have a friend that tried out verbs as her titles (jump, hug, smile, etc)…another just uses one word to describe her image.  Sometimes a label can help you take pictures – like an author writing an entire book based on a chosen title.  Pick a color theme, use only one room in your place, or choose a mood to portray.  Anything goes if it gets you in the habit of trying to accomplish that goal.  I didn’t have a theme when I started…except that I just knew it only had to be about my life, and my boys – for the most part that’s been true.  There have been a few images that aren’t of them, but that’s okay…it’s still my life and I’m still snapping everyday!  I did decide to shoot only landscape sized images – which has worked, except for a couple and I combined them with another image to keep my 4&#215;6 ratio.  Something really tricky for me would be to shoot mostly vertical.  Next year?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10828 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-05.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-05.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-05-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Plan Ahead</h4>
<p>Shooting daily is a part of my day.  I know it will happen.  Just like the kids will get fed and changed…at some point. Plan for it, but don’t stress about it.  If you have an idea when you wake up – awesome.  If you couldn’t come up with anything until 10pm, so be it.  About 2% of my daily images are shot before 10am…I am so not a morning person.  But maybe you are!  Take advantage of what time you are ‘on’ and love.  Maybe I have dinner plans out of the house one evening (um, okay maybe ONCE there were dinner plans, but whatever) I needed to make sure to get my daily in (and hopefully posted) before leaving.  Or one night I even took the camera out to a fancy restaurant where our supper club met!  Oh I have no shame.</p>
<p>The other part of it becoming your routine is how it affects your kids.  The frustration level was HIGH in the beginning…”ugh, that’s not what I wanted!!”  I had to breathe very deeply.  9 times out of 10, I wasn’t getting the picture that was in my head…little ones have their own agendas.  I’ve given out my fair share of fruit snacks as well. It’s fun to think back to the baby just sitting for me – I could have put him anywhere…he stayed. Why didn’t I use that more?  Cause now, running is hard to get.  And my three year old (2 when I started) has become accustomed to asking ‘mama when are you gonna take my picture?  You should take Mae’s (our dog) instead.’  He’s a stinker.</p>
<p>Oh and my husband?  I can’t leave him out.  Even though he doesn’t appear in lots of my ‘published’ daily pictures, he’s been nothing but supportive.  Sure, annoyed in the beginning but now I think he gets it.  He’s excited for people to see shots of his kids that his own wife took. Really thinking about that makes me want to cry a little!</p>

<h4>Helps Keep the Clutter (or embrace it)</h4>
<p>I’ve heard time and time again that daily shooting helps keep your house clean.  Oh I wish that were the case for me.  Yes, temporarily I’ll pick up but I’m not the neatest.  I did clean out my fridge the other day for the CMglimpse project on Instagram!  This is a fantastic benefit though…and one that your family will love you for (unless you’re making your kids clean their rooms)!  What if you’re fed up and can’t stand the mess!?  Leave! Take your camera outside…or down the street, to the store!  Give yourself an excuse to bring it somewhere.  Remember before photography became your job and you carried your DSLR everywhere?  Try it again for fun!  Nowadays I always have my iPhone on hand, but I do find myself wishing that my big-girl camera was in the bag too…especially if it’s the coveted golden hour.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10830 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-07.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-07.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-07-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Include Photos from your Business</h4>
<p>I initially thought that there was no way I could shoot personal images after a session&#8230;let alone editing a session. We all get sucked into our work. Lots of days we love it, but some days it’s really hard and drains our creativity. The cold hard truth is that taking pictures of your own kids after you’ve just been at a 4 hour newborn session is near impossible!  Maybe pull an image that you’ve recently taken but didn’t edit.  If you have a model release I don’t see anything wrong with sharing a client image that you love…as long as that fits into your personal project.</p>
<p>Also, I have to tell you that shooting daily has improved my client work – especially when I’m in new homes.  I pull from my recent experiences of shooting in low light, using interesting shadows or looking for different ways to tell a story that I would have never seen before.  I didn’t realize it was happening until one day ‘poof’ it just came to me and I was so excited…&#8221;sure we can shoot in this room with one tiny window and dark walls – no problem!&#8221;  I’m so thankful that this project has benefited both my professional and personal photography.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10831 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-08.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-08.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-08-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Create Balance</h4>
<p>I’d consider myself a perfectionist in certain areas (NOT when it comes to cooking) but with photography, I need to get it right.  My standards (for my personal work) are most of the time unattainable.  I’m very rarely 100% pleased with images I take.  Whatever my ‘issues’ are (ahem) I’ve had to let it go.  Everyday in fact!  See, it’s like therapy! There is a balance that comes with being okay with your work, but not settling…accepting your image for that day, and still striving to push yourself the next.  So much goes into something so subjective!  Did your kids behave, did you achieve the lighting conditions you were after, was your composition and exposure on?  What did you do well (celebrate it!) and what needs improvement? In the end, even if it was an off day, you’ve documented a part of your life.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10832 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-09.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-09.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-09-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>When you get Stuck</h4>
<p>Oh it happens.  It totally happens.  All too often!  You get stuck.  Finally you got in a rhythm…shooting daily had become routine, ideas were coming at you from left and right, your kids were being absolutely adorable and willing little models and then ACK!!!  brain freeze.  camera block.  Time out.  What now?  Well, here is a list that you are welcome to save and pull out if you need it.  Things you might not have thought about in the beginning – or ways to approach them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Self Portraits…do you dare?  Need inspiration?  <a href="http://www.megancieloha.com/" target="_blank">Megan Cieloha</a> comes to mind  – simply amazing.</li>
<li>Look at your images as a whole, what lenses/focal lengths are you using…switch it up from one day to the next… macro on Monday, wide on Tuesday, etc.</li>
<li>Are you favoring one child?  Don’t feel bad, sometimes it’s necessary!  School, schedules, teething, moodiness…but try a new baby, your significant other, pet – a neighbor even!</li>
<li>Low light!  Wait for it to get dark and turn all the lights off but one….ooooh yes, wait and crank up that ISO.  I read <a href="http://www.sarahwilkerson.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Wilkerson</a>’s <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/store/shop/shooting-from-the-shadows-ebook-2/" target="_blank">Shooting from the Shadows</a> and had lots of ah-ha moments.</li>
<li>Have fun with editing…use a new preset or create your own action – sometimes shooting with post processing in mind actually works!</li>
<li>Observe.  Again, I know you have the time to just sit around and look at what’s happening… but try it!!  One day when both of my kids were sick, my son and I stood out front and watched the bees and butterflies for a good hour, since we couldn’t leave the house.  That’s what I shot! (just a macro of the bee …nothing fantastic but it reminds me of that day)</li>
<li>What’s your favorite place (Target?) – go there and take a picture of it! (I’m just talking locally, but a vacay does sound nice!)</li>
<li>Shoot the season – what does the time of year remind you of?  When you look back at your pictures will it tell a complete story?  Trying to be creative with a holiday or season will really get you thinking.  I have one with Santa and it’s so bad technically, but magical at the same time!</li>
<li>Work those angles…try something new…but,</li>
<li>If you’re really stuck?  Go back to something comfortable.  Mine is backlight, low sun, the 85mm opened really wide.  That feels like home to me and if I’m stuck, I can shoot that and know I’ll be happy.  Who cares if Wednesday wasn’t creative as Tuesday.  No one will know and maybe you’ll surprise yourself!</li>
</ol>

<h4>Embrace the Unexpected</h4>
<p>Something that (I’m not sure why) didn’t click in the beginning was the unexpected benefit of having THOUSANDS of images of my kids – bad, poorly exposed, crappy color, crazy expression SNAPSHOTS that are so imperfectly great.  I’ll be honest and tell you that I strive to be creative and post work that I can stand behind…maybe not jaw dropping, but something about it is maybe ‘different’ or out of the norm for me (not all of course, but you get the gist.)  Honestly though when you look back on albums that your family has you don’t notice the angle it was shot from, that it’s ‘art’ or the color balance…right?  You see those relationships that live in your heart, your mom’s poor taste in kitchen wallpaper, and the time you dressed up as Miss Piggy for Halloween (heck yes I did!)  I mean – this is the unexpected GIFT that we are giving our kids when we take pictures of them almost daily…memories that they will flip through forever and make fun of their little brother over.</p>
<p>On that note – I do need some tips on organization + printing…going back through all these pictures is not my strong suite!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10834 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-11.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-11.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-11-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Find Community</h4>
<p>Wherever you’re posting and sharing your pictures…on the CMpro daily project, Clickin Moms’ picture shares or workshops…even your blog or facebook, there is something to be said about a community that accepts your work…and ultimately YOU.  I’ve made friends through this adventure and I really feel that in my heart.  I look forward to seeing others’ work, reading comments on pictures I admire, or my own shots and it just feels good that someone else can appreciate what we’re doing.  Yes we are all busy, yes we have a million+1 things to do, but with support and encouragement, shooting daily is absolutely possible.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10835 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-12.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-12.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-12-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Reward Yourself</h4>
<p>What will you do with your images when you’re finished?  I’m super excited to make a book of mine – it’s not going to be fancy (who has the time…ha!) but it will have everything I shot in there for an entire year.  I might curl up with it at night I’ll be so happy.  I’ve already printed 5x7s from half a year – which are just sitting on the desk and we flip through them.  Love that though!  Maybe think bigger and save up for an upgraded lens!!  (yes, please!)  or take some time off – but personally that scares me, I’m afraid to stop shooting!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10836 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-13.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-13.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/leah-daily-13-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Forgive the Oops</h4>
<p>So you skipped a day, two days…a week.  You haven’t taken a personal picture in over a month.  It’s like anything – what you eat, if you exercise…um, both of which I need help with…but enough about dieting.  My point is that it’s a choice.  If you want to shoot daily then you’ve got to set yourself up for success.  Stop beating yourself up for skipping a day, editing an image from earlier in the week, or quitting all together.  This isn’t a race or a competition. Remember that we’ve established that this is about YOU – your project.  Write out your goals and take baby steps. Take the weekends off, do a project 52, or decide that it’s okay to not even have a pattern!  Whatever works for you because there really are no rules.  I’m all over the place on this topic – even though I’ve committed to the DP, my upload times are sporadic and these last few weeks I’ve added images and had to post date a few.  Not for anyone else, but for me.  I wanted them in there as a record that I did indeed shoot daily.  Who says that you can’t make a come back?  I love that the daily project started in September…the 11th to be exact and I joined on the 12th.  This has fostered a laid back approach with the goal to post daily, but no resolutions hanging over your head.  Our babies get sick, then we might get it (no!) or you take a trip, have a tragic event happen, or just get in a rut.  It doesn’t help to get down on yourself but rather do what you can do.</p>
<p>Maybe shooting everyday (or week) isn’t your thing – that’s fine.  My entire point (probably of this post…bless you for reading it!) is to LOVE photography…learn and try new things with this craft that you enjoy, develop your style, make memories for your family, find that creative voice inside you, and be proud of what you can do with a camera and light – no matter if you’re shooting film, using a DSLR, an iPhone, point ‘n shoot…if you’re an experienced pro or total newbie.  Find why you love photography…create your own personal project and be excited to shoot.  How about tomorrow?…you don’t have to wait until a new year, a new anything…you just have to start.</p>

<p>So make sure you snap a few shots of your kiddos (and your clients’ little ones) being turkeys…before the begging, pleading, and bribing for the ‘good’ shots happen – you’ll laugh and thank me later!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a blog to showcase recent work is one of my favorite parts of being a photographer.  I love to blog both personal images and client sessions.  It’s a huge reward after hours of shooting and post processing to hit ‘publish’ on a post…I get butterflies almost every time.  Of course it always feels great to get blog ‘love’ and even better to know that my clients are appreciative.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Layout</span></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to layout a blog post.  Some photographers prefer single spaced-out images, some like to share entire galleries using a slideshow or grid, while others combine pictures together in different types of collages.  Personally, I love to create groupings and sometimes galleries.  I feel like a little kid cutting and pasting…fitting work together like a puzzle.  I absolutely LOVE seeing color, light, different angles and perspectives all together…it makes me positively giddy!  There is no right or wrong way to blog…it’s all about what appeals to you.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-8679 aligncenter" title="blogflow1" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="886" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow1-223x310.jpg 223w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow1-462x640.jpg 462w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Choosing Images</span></h2>
<p>Aside from personal work, there are two schools of thought on what photographs should appear on your blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only blog images that clients have purchased…this decreases the chance of pictures being used without your permission + carries incentive to boost sales.</li>
<li>Blog what you love, whether you’ve ‘sold’ it or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this is a choice you get to make as a photographer.  I’ve decided to blog what I love, showing only my favorite shots.  Watermarking is a great way to protect your work.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: avoid choosing images that are almost identical, mix it up a little to add interest.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-8680 aligncenter" title="blogflow2" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="913" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow2-217x310.jpg 217w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blogflow2-448x640.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Blogging Workflow</span></h2>
<p>Once you’ve decided on the layout and type of images you’d like to display, you’re ready to create your post.  Below are the steps in my blogging workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select images from a client gallery, then copy + paste into a subfolder</li>
<li>Choose a ‘header image’ that will be the width of my blog and makes a statement about the post</li>
<li>Group the remainder of the images in the order I want them to appear, taking into account how they will fit and look next to each other (i.e. close up, wide angle, eye contact, b/w, etc.)</li>
<li>There are lots of different ways to create blog boards – using layers in Photoshop, templates, actions, or scripts.  I use a combination of each so I have complete control</li>
<li>Once the layout is exactly like I’ve envisioned (make sure to save a layered psd doc just in case) I’ll flatten and resize the documents to the width of my blog</li>
<li>Next I’ll apply my logo with a watermark brush, sharpen, and save as jpegs</li>
<li>I upload the images to my blog and type in my title, text, and tags</li>
<li>Then I’ll share the link on facebook and send a private message to my client that they’re on the blog!</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tip</em>: posts that are broken up into several jpeg files can be easily pinned to Pinterest!</p>

<p>Blogging is extremely important as a photographer.  Not only does it showcase your recent work and style, but it can also be a record of life events.  It’s painful to look through really old images and posts, but I’m so thankful to have documented my photography journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">“…and the children were nestled all snug in their beds”</p>
<p>It’s impossible to not feel at peace when around a sleeping child…and the quiet is kinda nice too, oh and they stay still.  Taking pictures of our babies asleep (both when they’re big and small) is something we all need to do.  We’ve put together a few images and tips so you can create special snapshots of your children in dreamland.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Right Time</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">When to catch your kids in a deep sleep is more than important for pictures, and usually this is something only you will know.  <em><a href="http://www.laceymeyersphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lacey</a></em> and I both like to sneak in about 20 minutes after they’ve fallen asleep, and <em>Ashley</em> waits until it’s almost time for them to wake up…which could be important for those of you with light sleepers!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7476 aligncenter" title="sleeping child photography by Lacey Meyers" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lacey.jpg" alt="sleeping child photography by Lacey Meyers" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lacey.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lacey-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-7477 aligncenter" title="sleeping child photography by Ashley Spaulding" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ashley_02.jpg" alt="sleeping child photography by Ashley Spaulding" width="425" height="640" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ashley_02.jpg 425w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ashley_02-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></h6>
<h4>White Noise</h4>
<p>My little guys have always slept with a fan or white noise, so make sure it’s running if they’re used to it.  <em><a href="http://www.aprilnienhuis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April</a></em> also recommends playing soft music, which can help mask the sound of the shutter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7479 aligncenter" title="sleeping child photography by Leah Cook" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_02.jpg" alt="sleeping child photography by Leah Cook" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_02.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<h4>Different Angles</h4>
<p>Having a sleeping subject means you can really work your angles.  <em><a href="http://www.aprilnienhuis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April</a></em> says, “It&#8217;s the one time of day that your kids aren&#8217;t running around like a bunch of maniacs so take advantage of their motionlessness and experiment with all kinds of fun, new perspectives.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7481 aligncenter" title="photographing sleeping children tutoriald by Leah Cook" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_03.jpg" alt="photographing sleeping children tutoriald by Leah Cook" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_03.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/leah_03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7482 aligncenter" title="photographing sleeping children tutorial" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/april_02.jpg" alt="photographing sleeping children tutorial" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/april_02.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/april_02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4>Types of Light</h4>
<p>There are no rules with sleep photography.  Available, natural, or even using your flash can work! <em> Ashley’s</em> images are always full of light and her daughter’s bed is perfectly positioned by the window.  Leaving the overhead light on is always an option, or even a soft lamp or bathroom light. <em><a href="http://www.aprilnienhuis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April</a></em> suggests bouncing her speedlite off of a wall to create a dreamy glow.  As long as your child is in a deep sleep adding extra light shouldn’t wake them.  After reading through <em><a href="http://www.sarahwilkerson.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Wilkerson’s</a></em> book <em><a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/store/shop/shooting-from-the-shadows-ebook-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Shooting from the Shadows,’</a></em> I’ve pushed myself to shoot in low light and have really learned how to embrace the grain when I bump up my ISO.</p>

<h4>Make Adjustments</h4>
<p>Lots of us are used to positioning sleeping babies, but they are usually just a few days old and could care less.  It can be done with older kids!  By gently nudging a pillow or blanket out of the way you can expose tiny toes (or even put a baby next to his conked out big brother!)  <em><a href="http://www.aprilnienhuis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April</a></em> tells us, “In the following picture, her head was tilted in a way that was casting some weird shadows along her face but with the slight adjustment of lifting her head a little upward it was perfect. As long as you know they&#8217;re good and asleep at least, make any necessary changes needed to their position so that you get that beautiful light.”</p>

<h4>Prized Possessions</h4>
<p>Blankets, lovies, stuffed animals, etc. are such a big part of childhood, so make sure they’re in the picture too!  Your kids will enjoy reminiscing about a special bear or blankie they had when they were little. <em> Ashley’s</em> little man has quite the collection!</p>

<h4>Under the Weather</h4>
<p>It’s so sad when our babies feel sick, and typically they need lots of extra cuddles and snuggles.  Don’t forget to take advantage of their sleepiness!  This image was taken with my lensbaby.  Try a tilt-shift when they’re sleeping; it’s a great way to practice manual focus!</p>

<h4>Siblings</h4>
<p>I have yet to experience this, but I’m sure there is nothing sweeter than discovering TWO of your babies snuggled together.  This is definitely a time to drop everything, run, and get your camera! Thanks to Kathryn and Kendra for the gorgeous sibling shots…oh they will love these when they’re all grown up!</p>

<h4>Random Places</h4>
<p>I’ve always thought it was hilarious that kids could fall asleep just about anywhere.  Unfortunately mine don’t seem to do that, but what an opportune time to get a great picture!  These two images are from <em><a href="http://www.meganjanephotography.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan</a></em> – of her daughter asleep at a restaurant (bring the camera!) and her newborn son asleep while getting a bath.  SO CUTE!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7493 aligncenter" title="sleeping children photograph" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_01.jpg" alt="sleeping children photograph" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_01.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_01-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-7495 aligncenter" title="sleeping baby photography" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_021.jpg" alt="sleeping baby photography" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_021.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/meg_021-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>So when your baby takes her nap or the boys go to bed, don’t put the camera away!  Be sneaky and snap some beautiful images of the children nestled all snug in their beds…sweet dreams!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_2_0_96_131963130932550">It’s a big question. With so many choices out there, what lens should you choose and when? This isn’t intended to add to the Canon vs. Nikon debate or even persuade you to purchase an extremely expensive lens but rather to merely point out a few differences. Like many of you I’m fairly certain that I NEED every. single. lens. in the world, but that’s not a reality for me and I’ve learned to make due with what I own. Do I have a favorite? Maybe. We ask that question of every photographer we know, but really we need to be asking ourselves. What’s YOUR favorite? The lens you go to in a pinch, the one you feel comfortable with…that’s the important answer. Personally, I love to switch it up – at my sessions I challenge myself to use most of the lenses in my bag. When I first held the 85mm 1.2L in my hands, no doubt I fell in love…but I will admit, it was very hard to get used to. The weight was insane and it made me back waaaaaay up. Once I felt comfortable, it was my go-to…so much so that I dug myself into a rut. All of my images started to look and feel the same and although the bokeh is more than incredible, I needed to add some major variety. That being said, if you only have one lens it’s okay! Use your angles – get up high, roll in the leaves and when all else fails, rent one you have your eye on.<br />
<br id="yui_3_2_0_96_131963130932559" />The three lenses I’ve used for these images are all Canon: 85mm 1.2L, 50mm 1.4, 24-70mm 2.8L Remember that different lenses can achieve the ‘feeling’ you want in your pictures. The following images were all taken within the same minute, at the same distance + ISO, and all were opened up as wide as they could go. (I took two shots with the 24-70, one at 24mm and the other at 70mm).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6349 aligncenter" title="how your camera lens affects your photograph" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LeahCook11-e1319728895400.jpg" alt="how your camera lens affects your photograph" width="449" height="1200" /></p>
<p>So what did you notice? I see…the creamy bokeh that the 85 provides, the sparkle in the trees you get with the 50, and the versatility of the 24-70. Each lens provides a different version of ‘a baby and his pumpkin.’</p>
<p>The next image  is probably one of my favorite newborn portraits ever. I chose to use the 85 since we were outside and I could afford to back up (Mom was right next to baby &#8211; safety first!) The background wasn’t spectacular and I really wanted him to stand out. He was asleep and still, making the slow focus that sometimes occurs with this lens a non-issue. For that reason (among many others) the 85 focal length is a go-to for Senior photography and any other subjects that ‘listen’ to you for direction.</p>

<p id="yui_3_2_0_96_131963130932569">  During newborn sessions, my favorite part is watching mom and dad interact with their new little love. Those moments are priceless. Typically when I’m indoors I will choose either the 24-70 or my 50, depending on space and light. This room had great windows and it felt right to pop the wide angle on – I personally don’t mind the distortion on this type of image. You do have to be careful, however. It’s fun to play with at 24mm – doggie noses especially and it actually creates lovely blur when zoomed out to 70mm! *Side note – love this lens for sun flare and family sessions especially.</p>

<p id="yui_3_2_0_96_131963130932583"> Even though my 50 isn’t an ‘L series’ I absolutely love this classic lens. It’s light and perfect for chasing babies and toddlers. Plus for someone who’s on the short side (okay…I’m super short) the focal length rocks. I can get close to my subject and it will focus quickly, but also shoot from above without necessarily needing extra height. Oh and if you haven’t noticed I’m a tiny bit addicted to pretty light sparkles.</p>

<p>One last note. If you find yourself fumbling your lenses at a session, practice using them more at home with your own family. I’m so thankful for the <em><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmprodaily/" target="_blank">CMpro Daily Project</a></em> blog – I’ve been able to get use out of all of my glass and it’s been a blast! Hoping next time to feature images from the 35 1.4L or a tilt shift!??  A girl can dream!!</p>
