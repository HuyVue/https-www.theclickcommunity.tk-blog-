			<p>There’s nothing that I love more than shooting a hospital newborn session, except for maybe delivering the finished gallery.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to share with you today an edit from one of my favorite sessions of 2017.</p>
<p>Meet Quinn. I joined Quinn at the hospital to document his arrival just moments after his parents met him for the first time.</p>
<p>Being my first adoption story, I was so excited to document it and it really was a special session. I chose an image to share with you that is focused on the baby, but also shows the sweet connection with his parents.</p>
<p>My motto in life is to keep things simple. I love shooting with a passion and I love finding light and making it a part of the story.</p>
<p>Here, I wanted to keep the depth of the shadows while watching exposure on the white blanket. I set my white balance in camera using Kelvin and, as you’ll see, it allowed for my RAW edit to stay minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/color-by-kelvin-a-better-approach-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color by Kelvin: A better approach to white balance</a></strong></p>
<p>My editing workflow includes both Lightroom and Photoshop. I keep sessions organized in Lightroom under session type and the client’s name so that they are easy to find or reference as needed. When I open a RAW edit from Lightroom into Photoshop and save it, it saves the PSD file right next to the RAW file in my Lightroom Catalog, which I love.</p>
<p>My process includes a basic RAW edit using the tools in the Basic panel first, then adding a touch of contrast in the tone curve, my tiny touch in the Split Toning panel, and finally, noise reduction. My edits are then polished off in Photoshop using a series of Curves Layers.</p>
<p>Overall, the process is simple and I have learned to customize it based on light and the story that I want to tell. The finished product is a clean, punchy edit &#8211; my favorite!</p>
<p>The following video will show you step-by-step how I achieve my edit on sweet Quinn’s image. Included below are a few shortcuts on my favorite must-have steps between Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>
<h2>2. Start with white balance and exposure.</h2>
<p>If you are setting a custom white balance in camera, this should be a minor adjustment. I tend to underexpose just a bit, unless I am working with really low light. I find that I often bump exposures and warm images up just a touch.</p>
<h2>2. Make your go-to adjustments .</h2>
<p>My go-to adjustments are the adjustments that I make on almost every single image. I bump up clarity (typically +10), add a touch of vibrance (+3), and take out a touch of saturation (-2).</p>
<p>I always add luminance to reduce noise and create a tiny S-curve in the Tone Curve Panel. And my favorite little trick is to add a bit of split toning. My magic numbers are a Hue of 21 in the Highlights with Saturation set at 3.</p>
<h2>3. Polish it off.</h2>
<p>With basic adjustments complete in Lightroom, it’s time to polish it off in Photoshop. I do this with a series of Curves Layers.</p>
<p>The first is meant for the image as a whole. Then the next layers are used to work on individual parts of the image to draw the eye where I want it to go. It’s finished off with one last Curves Layer set to Soft Light at a lowered opacity, for overall contrast. This step is best explained in the video, where you can see exactly how I achieve my goal.</p>

			<p>This system works for me.</p>
<p>If you want in on a secret, it’s that just about every image that I create is edited the exact same way, from moody indoor images to backlit sunset images. I’m a creature of habit, and once I found what works for me, I have yet to stray.</p>
<p>Simple really is beautiful!</p>

			<p>The first hours, the first moments.</p>
<p>As mothers, we believe that we will hold onto these memories for the rest of our lives, but the truth is that the memories are fleeting, and as our children grow and change, our hearts will grow and change with them.</p>
<p>I would give anything to go back and document that time in my life with intention, looking to capture every detail I knew I’d miss one day.</p>
<p>Photographing newborns in the hospital is a growing trend, and it is one that I am happy to include as part of my business, and something I love teaching other photographers to do as well.</p>
<p>There is so much emotion tied into this, from all sides. It’s a beautiful thing to document, and an absolute honor for me to do for so many families.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a professional newborn photographer, a hobbyist, or just a mother who wants to remember every little thing about the first moments with your new baby, this is for you.</p>
<h2>Find and use the light</h2>
<p>What am I looking for when I walk into a hospital room? Light, light, light.</p>
<p>Every hospital is set up differently, and where some will have large rooms with a wall of windows, others may be small with a tiny window tucked into a corner. My first mission is to locate a natural light source and place the bassinet in front of it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61497" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake.jpg" alt="I would give anything to go back and document those first few days with my newborn with intention, looking to capture every detail I knew I’d miss one day." width="1600" height="1068" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake.jpg 1600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-840x561.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-200x134.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/picture-of-dad-holding-newborn-in-the-hospital-by-Brittany-Blake-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2>Use the traditional hospital items</h2>
<p>I personally love the hospital issued swaddling blankets, hats, and shirts. The items may not hold personal meaning, but they speak to a very specific time period, one that cannot be mistaken.</p>
<p>So, with baby swaddled tight in pink and blue, I place her in the bassinet, still in front of the window, and shoot from various angles. When baby is warm and sleepy, I’ll remove the swaddle and capture the details like little feet and umbilical cord. I try to keep this quick as babies have a hard time regulating their body temperature.</p>

			<h2>Shoot in live view</h2>
<p>Now mamas, you’ve just given birth. You’ve created a human being, and that is an incredible task! My favorite trick for hospital sessions is going to be your best friend.</p>
<p>It took me years of shooting dSLR to learn about this, mostly because I just didn’t see the benefit. I love using it to set white balance, but that isn’t the best part.</p>
<p>Live view will allow you to use angles and composition in ways that would require so much extra effort when shooting through the viewfinder. Another benefit is that you can set focus by zooming into your subjects, eliminating any errors or guessing that may occur.</p>

<h3>The How To?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Switch your camera into live view mode.</li>
<li>Hold your camera at the desired angle. If you have a tilting screen, you can get even more creative.</li>
<li>Find the composition that you desire and toggle the focus box so that you can zoom into the desired area of the image.</li>
<li>While zoomed in, set focus manually with your focus ring.</li>
<li>Get your shot. You do not need to zoom out to do so, but I typically check the image to confirm it’s what I was going for.</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of documenting your own baby in the hospital is that you can take your time.</p>
<h2>Mama and Daddy, too</h2>
<p>While individual portraits of baby are important, don’t forget to document the love and connection of other family members as well. I strongly encourage you to get in the frame, too, mamas. This is the perfect time to get your settings in place and give dad a quick tutorial on where to place the focus box and let him snap away.</p>
<p>I love to use side light for parent or sibling shots, whether that means standing to the side of the window, or sitting on a piece of furniture. Have the person hold the baby to their chest, ask them to be sure the baby’s face is toward the window.</p>

<p>Another option is to have them hold the baby with bottom on chest, feet pointing up, and head cradled in their hands. This pose will allow for a variety of angles.</p>

			<h2>Include siblings</h2>
<p>For younger siblings, a sturdy chair paired with a boppy pillow for support are always a hit. It’s also incredibly sweet to have a parent holding the baby with the older sibling snuggling up. No matter the situation, simplicity is key, as the emotion will take center stage.</p>

<p>Hospital photography is a wonderful time to give up the idea of posing and perfection, and embrace the beauty of the moment. Everyone is filled to the brim with emotion, so in love with this new little life. Well, there are times that siblings take some warming up, but that’s worth documenting, too.</p>
<p>Over the course of your hospital stay, if you’re documenting this time for yourself, capturing the baby in the bassinet, and documenting the connection of family and friends with your baby is a priceless gift you’re giving to future you. If you’re a friend or a photographer coming in to document this new life, you can do so in under an hour, and in a way that requires no extra effort from the new parents.</p>
<p>The session itself is simple, but the images produced as a result are something to be treasured for many, many years. If you can’t tell, this is where my heart lies, and I’d spend every day documenting new life if I could.</p>

<p>If you’re nodding your head right now, we are connected. This was me, last year, and the year before that. I had committed myself to so many things, and I had failed at each and every one. 30 Day Projects. Project 52s. 365s. Time and time again, I let myself down. Today, I am here to share my journey of acceptance, my very own personal project that has changed me as an artist, and has shown me so much about who I am as a mother.</p>
<p>It was the end of 2015, and I had this little idea that I laughed about. How hard would it be to take ONE picture per day? How hard would it be to let go of imperfection? How hard would it be to accept my own mistakes? How hard would it be to slow down? Could I ever let go of my chronic habit of overshooting?</p>

<p>I told no one about this idea until the very last minute. Friends thought I was a bit crazy. My family had no idea what I was talking about. I had very little faith in myself to make it through a week, let alone a month, or a year. So, I promised myself no expectations. Then, on January 1, 2016, the “Single Frame Project” was born.</p>
<p>Each day, I find inspiration to take a single frame. No matter the outcome, that shot is it for the project on that particular day. The trick is shooting with intention, or purpose. Taking my time to frame the shot just so.  Carefully watching the light. Waiting out the desired expressions. Then, I share it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britt_blake/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">my Instagram</a> with my thoughts, whether they be silly, or heartfelt. At the end of the year, I create a book.</p>

<p>Sounded simple. Sounded fun.</p>
<p>There have been moments of joy, of frustration, of exhaustion. There have been days that I felt so inspired upon waking up that my camera was the first thing that I picked up. There have been days that I climbed into bed at night without thinking once about my camera. Those days have been the hardest. There has been triumph. There has been failure. Oh, has there been failure!</p>

<p>But the beauty of it all? No matter what, it was just ONE picture. My lack of faith in myself was unfounded. Today, I take image number 120. I have a collection of photographs that make my heart sing, not because they are technically perfect, believe me, they are not. They are perfect, however, because they are my life. It’s only a glimpse, but together, this collection of photographs will make up a year of laughter, of sadness, of injuries, of accidents, the happy ones, and the ones that make me cringe.</p>
<p>I don’t sit down to cull and find my favorite. I don’t debate on sharing. I put myself out there on a daily basis no. matter. what.</p>

<p>Now, you may wonder about how taking on this project has changed me? Well, it has happened, but slowly. By sharing the pieces of myself that come with a project like this, I have been forced to share not only imperfections in my photography, but of myself as a person, and as a mother. Cereal for dinner in front of an iPad? Mom “WIN” on record. It is through sharing these imperfections that I have learned to not only accept them, but respect them. This journey, it ebbs and flows. Some days are full of creativity and fantastic light, great composition, perfect moments. There are other days that people must wonder if I have any idea what the buttons on my camera actually do! Instead of stressing about the “bad” photographs, I laugh at them, and at myself. Then I move on. So liberating!</p>

<p>Creativity isn’t typically viewed as a tangible thing, but maybe we should think of it that way. We don’t always have extra room in our pockets for that spark of creativity. Sometimes it’s filled with other life things that aren’t as fun, but when we make room for it, when we dig deep to find it, it shines so bright.</p>
<p>I understand that this type of project isn’t for everyone, but I do hope that it has shown you that even when something feels unattainable, you have the power to reach just a little farther. Take on a project. If you fail, try again. The trick is to find something that means something to you. Without purpose, failure is just waiting fin the shadows, arms open wide. Find your purpose, embrace it. If you’re feeling brave, join in with me. Even for a day, find that little slice of inspiration and take just one shot. It may be a day that you wouldn’t have picked up your camera otherwise, it may be a day that you want to document the moment, but stay present with your children. It can be what you need it to be in the moment.</p>

<p>If you’d like to follow along, or share Single Frame images of your own, you can do so on Instagram with the hashtag #thesingleframeproject. At some point before midnight EST, there will be an image tagged by me with the corresponding day. It may be something I feel proud to share with the world, it may not. It’s just me, sharing. The good days, and the bad days. This project is a collection of every little piece of my heart and soul.</p>
<p class="size-full wp-image-39188 alignleft">My hope is that when you find inspiration, you don’t allow your fears to hold you back. Get out there and make some magic!</p>

<p>We’ve all felt it, right? That little spark&#8230; It can come from just about anywhere and it usually comes out of nowhere, or so it seems. I spent time over the past month overwhelmed with inspiration.</p>
<p>You see, I attended <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/clickaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click Away</a> and spent three days with 1,000 other women who share in this medium of expression that I am absolutely addicted to. I speak to those of you with a camera in your hands because it is what I know, but no matter how you express yourself, your creativity, your emotions&#8230; this is for you.</p>

<p>It’s no coincidence that this post falls on the heels of that incredible conference. No doubt about it. I have never felt so much inspiration in such a short period of time. It was just incredible and I cannot wait to do it again. With that said, when I left Utah, I was feeling so many things at once that I just kept my head down and made it my mission to get home to my family. I didn’t allow myself to think too hard about those feelings because they were hard to face. I sat at home on Monday and ignored the world (and my house, ahem) and spent time with my kids. It was great! In the back of my mind, though, I knew what I was doing. I was ignoring the inspiring words of those speakers because I didn’t want to face them. I didn’t want to face the fact that I am doing things in my business, in my life, that don’t satisfy my soul. That’s my big confession&#8230; and you know what? It feels great to share it! I am taking responsibility for it and I am going to change it. I won’t tell you how but I promise that the change will be immediate and you will be able to see it.</p>

<p>This world, it throws a lot at us. We are busy trying to chase our dreams, raise our families, and just&#8230; be. It is so easy to feel good about something one moment and then let it slip away because there is just so. much. to. do. This right here? This is my plea to you to <strong>STOP</strong>. Just stop whatever you are doing and listen. When you feel stuck, talk to someone. Talk to me, your friends, a stranger&#8230; I mean, maybe introduce yourself first (ha!) but the point is to just say it out loud!! Give your inspiration a name, a purpose, a voice, and set it free in this big, crazy world. Go out and share your gift. You have one, I promise. It’s not doing anyone any good locked up inside of you. You never know when or how or why you will influence or have an impact on another person in this life. Even if you feel inspired to do something for yourself and never share it with the world, doing so just might change you in a way that is really changing the world, too.</p>

<p>So, what’s my point? My point in all of this is that inspiration is thrown at us constantly but what do you do about it? How do you take action? Feeling inspired is not enough. It’s just not. I can’t tell you how to act on your inspiration. It’s different for everyone. I can tell you why, though. Do it to feel something. Do it because you love someone. Do it to share something that you love with the world. Do it to feed your soul.</p>

<p>If there was one thing that was bigger than anything else that I took home with me from Utah, it’s this: <strong>Believe in yourself</strong>. Your self doubt does NOT control you, it just wants you to think that. How are you going to prove it wrong?</p>
<p>Me? I’m going to look at the two beautiful faces that I brought into this world and appreciate them every single day. I’m going to keep on chasing the sun, and I’m going to wait for that next spark of light, ready to make my move.</p>
<p>Inspiration isn’t simply a feeling, waiting on us to act. You’ll find a second definition and this is it, “<em>The drawing in of breath, inhalation</em>.”</p>
<p>Think about how powerful that is. Take it in and let it take hold, but make sure to exhale.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>
