			<p>Every photographer wants to find her unique voice, to make her photography stand out and be an extension of who she is.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to do in this media saturated world.</p>
<p>So just how does a girl hone in on her own creative style? How does she know she&#8217;s being true to herself?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been through this whole process myself and though I still feel I’m a work in progress, I want to share the steps I took to discover who I am as a photographer and how I discovered my aesthetic.</p>
<h2>1. First, look to your home and closet.</h2>
<p>These things can tell you a lot about yourself that you might not even realize!</p>
<p>Look around. How have you decorated your home? Do you use bold colors or pastels? Are the items you collect modern or classic? Are you organized or eclectic?</p>
<p>Now walk into your closet. (Or if you’re more like me, go eye the piles of laundry on the couch.) Is your closet full of new and trendy items or are you sentimental and hold on to old pieces? Do you collect bold prints or do you prefer pretty florals? Do you like to stand out in a crowd wearing bright colors like red and yellow or do you look more mellow wearing only shades of blue and gray?</p>
<p>Remember, there are not any correct answers. Instead, your home and what you wear are most likely a good reflection of YOU!</p>
<p>In my home, I painted the doors and trim a dark brown to pop against our very light yellow walls. I also painted an entire room and the back of a built in bookshelf a hue of navy blue. Just looking around, it’s very apparent to me that I love contrast and the color blue!</p>

			<h2>  2. Look to your Pinterest boards.</h2>
<p>Is there a recurring theme in the pictures you save? Are you attracted to florals and weddings? Perhaps moody documentary images dominate your collection.</p>
<p>Next, scroll through your favorite blogs, Instagram accounts and Facebook groups. Dog ear photos in magazines. Check out art books from the library. When a photo makes you stop and stare for a second, articulate why. Say it out loud. Write it down.</p>
<p>Is it the composition? Is it the connection between two people? Is it the light? Is it the shadows? Is it the color or lack of color? Find what you are personally attracted to and then ask yourself: would you have created that photo the same way? What would you have done differently? I learn all about my personal weaknesses and preferences from answering these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>For example, though I may like a picture with desaturated greens, I know I would edit with very bright and colorful greens.</p>
<h2>3. Combine the images of which you are most proud into a portfolio.</h2>
<p>As you do this, you’ll start to notice some patterns in your work &#8211; perhaps both good and bad! This can be awesome for personal artistic growth.</p>
<p>When putting together my business photography blog, I suddenly connected the dots and was able to identify my strengths as a photographer. It was glaringly apparent that I love clean lines and bold color!</p>

			<h2>4. Own it.</h2>
<p>Discovering my aesthetic has been a lesson in self acceptance. It’s true, there is always room for growth and improvement in our art. And while we are generally always trying to make our weaknesses become strengths, there are just some things that are undeniably unique to each of us.</p>
<p>In other words, you really are one in seven billion! No one else on earth has the same combination of personality, humor, talent, intelligence, or background and life experience. Therefore, the potential of what you create is going to be unique to you and only you.</p>
<p>So do some soul searching. Ask your closest family members and friends to tell you the things they notice and admire about you. Just what are your talents and strengths? What life experiences set you a part from many people? How do you see the world? Who are you?</p>
<p>In short, I am a very yellow colored personality. I am friendly and outgoing. Sunshine makes me happy and I love adventuring outside with my family. My childhood was spent playing at the beach and sailing with my Dad. But I’m also a bit red. I thrive on routine and organization.</p>
<p>Recently, I realized how much of an influence my talent playing the violin has had on my photography. I began studying the violin at age five and played on a scholarship all through college. At first, it was imperative that I learn all the technical aspects: keeping my left wrist straight, holding the bow with a bent thumb and pinky, intonation, etc.</p>
<p>As a child, I imitated the songs I heard. I sounded like a robot playing Gavotte from Mignon. But as I matured and mastered the technicalities, I began to play with emotion; real emotion straight from the heart. I’ve come to realize that this is one of my God given gifts.</p>
<p>So what does my experience with learning the violin have to do with photography? Quite a bit, actually. In photography, I am a rule follower nearly to the T. All of my compositions are either centered or use the rule of thirds. If I miss focus at all, I throw the image out. I have to know my camera inside-out and why the image turned out as it did.</p>
<p>This is parallel to me as a child learning all the technicalities of the violin; everything has to be correct. Now, as a photographer, I feel that I have mastered the basic rules of picture taking. I am currently on a journey to infuse more emotion into my photos. It’s going to take time and a little more soul-searching for me to get there, but I believe I will.</p>
<p>For now though, my photos are bright and warm and colorful. They’re full of sunflares and backlight and happy children. I feel they are reflections of what makes me happy. And I am proud of the images I make.</p>

			<h2>5. Learn to make consistent edits.</h2>
<p>In the age of RAW files and computer editing programs, the sky is the limit in creative power. There is nothing holding an artist back from creating what she envisions. However, these programs take time and practice to learn to manipulate.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to first master white balance. We all know when skin tones look beautiful. Oppositely, most everyone can eye when something is wrong with skin even if they can’t explain exactly what it is. Elevate your photography by getting skin tones right.</p>
<p>Next, watch videos of editing. The <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickin Moms forum</a> is full of great editing tutorials. Many of my favorite editing videos have come from the breakouts of talented artists I admire. They can be eye opening!</p>
<p>Then, experiment with purchased presets. (Some well-known favorites are VSCO, Tribe Archipelago, SMAL, and Mastin Labs.) Knowing how to set white balance makes good presets beautiful. Presets have also helped me learn the ins and outs of Lightroom and the potential for every panel. They have pushed my editing (for example, the contrast) a little further than I was originally comfortable with.</p>
<p>Now when I look at a RAW photo, I know what I want it to become. Whether I&#8217;m using a preset or editing by hand, I can compare two or three images side-by-side and see very minute differences. My husband rolls his eyes because he can&#8217;t tell the difference but I think it’s fabulous because that means I have found my editing style.</p>
<h2>6. Step away from social media.</h2>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to be creative when our heads are full of other people&#8217;s ideas or worse, when we are creating for someone else. I sometimes find myself getting caught up in comparing my work with someone else’s and it honestly doesn’t feel very good.</p>
<p>Instead, social media is meant for sharing the things we’re excited and passionate about! (At least I think so anyway.)</p>
<p>So step away. Create for yourself. Learn for yourself. Take classes. Study. Experiment. Remember, this is your art. Own it. Then share it. If it makes you happy, then you&#8217;re on your way to fulfilling your personal artistic bucket.</p>
<h2>7. Repeat steps in any order when necessary.</h2>
<p>Now use these steps to help find your artistic voice!</p>

			<p>Seven years ago, when I first began my journey into photography, my husband gifted me with the cheap but fantastic <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/ef-50mm-f-18-stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens</a>.</p>
<p>It rocked my world! I loved it.</p>
<p>I opened up that aperture wide and was suddenly able to capture those beautiful compressed backgrounds and bokeh I’d been craving. It was exciting!</p>
<p>But as I studied more about the exposure triangle &#8211; how the variables of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO associate to determine the exposure of a photograph &#8211; I realized that I wasn’t using my lens to its entire capacity nor was my photography growing and improving to its full potential.</p>
<p>Wrapping my head around the exposure triangle was tricky for me at first. But with lots of practice, changing my camera settings became second nature. I want to share not only the settings on a few of my photographs, but the brief story behind them and WHY I chose the aperture I did.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> When starting to work with aperture, begin by shooting in aperture priority mode. Set your aperture and keep your eye on the shutter speed. If it’s too fast then bring the ISO down. If the shutter speed is too slow then bring the ISO up.</p>
<h2>Example 1: f/2</h2>
<p>This is one of my all time personal favorite photographs. I was quickly brushing through my hair after a shower when I spied my naked baby in the mirror playing with the roll of toilet paper &#8211; classic babyhood!</p>
<p>I hastily shut off the lights, opened the blinds on a window, and sprinted for my camera halfway across the house. On my way back to the bathroom, I quickly adjusted my camera settings.</p>
<p>I’d shot in that bathroom before and knew it was relatively dark. That morning, there happened to be wildfire smoke covering much of the sun, making the light coming through the window weaker than usual.</p>
<p>My goal was to achieve a shutter speed of 1/250 or more in order to freeze his moving arms and hands. Because of the relative darkness, I raised my ISO to 3200 and set my aperture to f/2 to let in more light. The combination of those two variables made my shutter speed 1/320.</p>
<p>I sat down on the floor and got about four shots in before the baby lost interest and the moment was over. Fortunately, I got this keeper of a photograph!</p>

			<h2>Example 2: f/2.5</h2>
<p>Who doesn’t love <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/the-photographers-guide-to-backlighting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creamy golden backlight</a>?</p>
<p>My go-to aperture setting is usually f/2.2-2.8. For me, it’s the perfect balance between a compressed background and nailing focus on my moving boys because the plane of focus is just a little bit wider than if I shot completely wide open at f/1.4.</p>
<p>On this particular summer evening, I was in the backyard with the baby enjoying the last of the sunshine. He began scooting his way through the grass and that’s when I pulled out my camera.</p>
<p>With an aperture of f/2.5 and an ISO of 400, my shutter speed was very quick at 1/2000. In retrospect, I could have dropped my ISO down a couple clicks to allow for a slower shutter speed. This would allow more time for light to hit the sensor which can add to that dreamy feel in a photograph! But I like how this backlit photo turned out anyhow.</p>

			<h2>Example 3: f/4</h2>
<p>When I’m outside, I like to use a slightly smaller aperture as I’m often trying to shoot multiple people, or in this case, movement.</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon, my five-year-old son was having a blast swinging so high that his toes touched the leaves in the treetops. I wanted to capture that moment. I plopped myself down on the grass, composed my shot, and waited for my son to swing into the frame.</p>
<p>Because he was moving so fast, I focused on the branch that he was consistently hitting. Since it was hard to predict exactly where he’d swing, I knew I needed a bigger plane of focus. Thus, I chose an aperture of f/4.</p>
<p>Because I stopped my aperture down a few clicks, there was suddenly less light entering my camera lens. I checked my shutter speed and noticed that it was slow for an action shot. Therefore, I increased my ISO to 400. That increased my camera’s sensitivity to light and in turn raised my shutter speed to a nice 1/500.</p>

			<h2>Example 4: f/8</h2>
<p>I took my boys on a nature hike one evening where we were rewarded with a breathtaking view of the Snake River and a distant thunderstorm.</p>
<p>They were content to sit on a rock to look for moose while I stepped back to capture the scene. The background was just as big, if not bigger, a subject than my boys in the foreground.</p>
<p>I knew that If I shot wide open at f/1.4, my background might become a compressed smear of colors. However, I wanted to capture the scene as I saw it so I stopped down my aperture to f/8. The smaller aperture makes my boys sharp but also allows the viewer to see some details in the background, too.</p>
<p>Because my lens opening at f/8 was now much smaller and let in less light than my previous aperture, I had to increase the ISO to 1250 to ensure a nice quick shutter speed of 1/400.</p>

			<h2>Example 5: f/13</h2>
<p>It’s become an evening ritual at our house this Fall to toss the football around in the backyard. On this particular evening, the sun was setting and that beautiful golden hour light was calling my camera.</p>
<p>I could have shot this backlit scene with a wide aperture, but I wanted to do something different. Instead, I closed my aperture to f/13 in hopes of creating a starburst effect.</p>
<p>Shooting towards a light source with a narrow opening will cause the light to hit the edges of the len’s diaphragm and cause the light to diffract, or make a starburst. My aperture was small and the sun was fading fast so I had to make some adjustments. In order to get a quick shutter speed of 1/800 to freeze the ball, I cranked my ISO to 3200.</p>

			<p>Are you a mom with a camera who likes to take pictures of her kids?</p>
<p>Do you feel like it&#8217;s important to document your family&#8217;s life?</p>
<p>Have you ever held back from posting ALL of your vacation photos to social media because you felt like it was a terrible faux pas?</p>
<p>Do you feel like your images need a home other than your hard drive so that they can be shared and enjoyed?</p>
<p>Have you ever started a blog only to let it die?</p>
<p>If you answered &#8216;yes&#8217; to any of the above questions, then what I&#8217;m about to say is for you!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping a personal blog for eight years. It began two years after my sweetheart and I were married.</p>
<p>Not long after, we were expecting our first baby and I found myself gravitating towards learning how to use a camera. Before I knew it, my habit for writing and my passion for photography merged onto the perfect platform for me: a blog!</p>
<p>Words cannot express how grateful I am to have countless memories recorded, all bringing back a rush of feelings and taking me to those special (and sometimes not-so-special) moments in time.</p>
<p>I am now a mom to three little boys and have a part time photography business. Life is busy, but I&#8217;ve figured out a few tips and tricks along the way to keep blogging (aka our family&#8217;s memories) from feeling like an overwhelming chore.</p>
<p>It really is a doable task! And can be an enjoyable one, too.</p>
<h2>Tips for writing your blog:</h2>
<p>If a picture speaks a thousand words, how much does a picture accompanied by a paragraph speak?</p>
<h3>How often do you want to post on your blog?</h3>
<p>Does three or four times a week seem daunting? How about posting just once a week instead? Don&#8217;t feel discouraged if you get behind.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a wonderful button that lets you schedule your posts. That means you can set a date and a time to publish that post in the future OR you can back date it to the correct time the action actually took place. I openly admit to back dating posts often, especially when it takes me a month or more to edit sixty vacation pictures!</p>
<p>Take the pressure off yourself. Make blogging work for you and your schedule. This is your life, after all.</p>

			<h3>Jot down notes throughout the day.</h3>
<p>Record anything that is meaningful to you inside your phone&#8217;s notes or memo app. It can be a fleeting thought, something funny your child said, or the best and worst things that happened to you that day.</p>
<p>Our phones always seem to be within reach, utilize it. When it&#8217;s time to sit down at the computer and you&#8217;re suddenly staring at a blank white space to fill, you already have some ideas with which to start.</p>
<h3>For the love of bullet points.</h3>
<p>When writing a blog post, don&#8217;t underestimate the power of bullet points. Think of using titles like, &#8216;Our Top Three Weekend Highlights&#8217;.</p>
<p>Then simply write three paragraphs of 3-5 sentences each. Voila. A blog post practically writes itself.</p>

<h3>Use repeated titles to make a series.</h3>
<p>A friend I know uses &#8216;Quarterly Quotes&#8217; to write down the funny things her boys have said over the last few months. As for me, I have several series that have come and gone and sometimes get resurrected. Right now I do monthly updates for my baby and purge all my extra photos under the label, &#8216;Snapshots of Life Lately&#8217;.</p>
<h3>You don&#8217;t have to write a novel.</h3>
<p>Sometimes a single photo (or three or five) with a few words attached is more than enough, just like Instagram.</p>
<p>Remember, this is your life you&#8217;re recording! Not every detail needs to be documented, just the ones that are meaningful to you and that you want to share.</p>

<h2>Tips for your blog photos:</h2>
<h3>Manage all your photos.</h3>
<p>I manage and edit all of my photos with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightroom CC</a>. When I&#8217;m ready to post pictures to my blog, I simply export them using the following settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I press ctrl and then click on all of my landscape pictures in Lightroom.</li>
<li>Then I head up to File-Export. I export all of my blog pictures to a monthly folder that I use specifically for uploading to the web.</li>
<li>I rename the pictures &#8216;BLOG&#8217; followed by whatever it was that we were doing. For example, &#8216;BLOG Raspberry Picking’.</li>
<li>Then I resize to fit along the long edge at 650 pixels across at a resolution of 100 pixels per inch. The reason I resize my pictures to 650 pixels across is because that is exactly how wide the main area of my blog is. Your blog might be more narrow or more wide.</li>
<li>I sharpen for the screen and press export.</li>
<li>Then I begin again and click on all of my portrait photos that I want for the blog. The only change that I make during export is to fit along the short edge 650 pixels across. You&#8217;ll find out exactly why in the next step!</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, the above export settings can be made into a one click preset!</p>
<h3>Upload your pictures to your blog.</h3>
<p>I use the Blogger platform since that&#8217;s what I started with and it suits my needs just fine.</p>
<ol>
<li>I start by uploading all of the pictures I just exported at once.</li>
<li>Then, in the upload window, the order in which I click on the photos is the order in which they will load into my post. Easy!</li>
<li>Then I click on each picture and choose &#8216;original size&#8217;. (WordPress has a nifty little button on the right side of the upload window that lets you choose the size of your pictures before posting them into the body of your blog post.) I&#8217;ve found that using the original size for my photos not only makes them big, but keeps them nice and crisp and beautiful, instead of getting compressed and slightly fuzzy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Print your blog.</h3>
<p>Lastly, you&#8217;ve put a lot of time and heart into your blog, be sure to print it! If you Google &#8216;blog to book&#8217;, many options will pop up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally used <a href="http://www.blog2print.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog2print</a> over the years since it is so quick and easy. I print my blog yearly and now have a nice little stack of volumes sitting on my living room shelf. It&#8217;s like the ultimate scrapbook!</p>
