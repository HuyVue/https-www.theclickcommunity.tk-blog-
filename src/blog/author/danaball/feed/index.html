			<p>Back in September 2017, in a temporary moment of madness, we adopted a tiny black kitten. Inspired by his undeniable cuteness, I embarked upon a personal project. This project didn&#8217;t just document our adorable new family member, but also grew me as an artist.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/loveable-pet-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 lovable pet pictures you won&#8217;t be able to resist</a></strong></p>
<p>Have you ever considered shooting the same subject every day for an extended period of time? Do you fear you would get bored or maybe run out of ideas?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a valid concern! But what if the challenges and limitations that come from shooting the same subject actually sharpened your photography skills? Instead of becoming bored, what if your creativity flourished? What if this simple exercise in <em>sameness</em>, caused you to see <em>differently</em>?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what happened to me.</p>

			<h1>Finding the light</h1>
<p>Following my kitten throughout my house, I began to look for light more intentionally than I had before. I didn&#8217;t want him to look like a black blob in all of my images! Therefore, I had to find the light, use it well, and nail my exposure.</p>
<p>Like many photographers, I sometimes find myself complaining that my house doesn’t have good enough light. However, photographing my black kitten every day proved me wrong!</p>

			<p>Over time, I began to think about light as part of my <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/better-snapshots-elements-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">composition</a>. One of the biggest benefits of photographing the same subject daily is that it forces you to seek variables to make that singular subject more interesting.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Light is the perfect variable as it can be so easy and interesting to manipulate! Try shooting at various times of day. Set-up shots in rooms where the light enters at different angles. Or simply change your position in relation to the light.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to explore this element of the frame in a way that challenges you creatively and keeps your photography fresh and exciting.</p>

			<p>I remember the thrill of the moment I noticed this beautiful rim light that outlined my kitten perfectly. Simply moving so that the light falls behind your subject can create the most beautiful halo of light and can transform even the most mundane subject into something beautiful.</p>
<h1>Movement, moments, and telling the story</h1>
<p>As I shot photos of my black kitten every day, I became increasingly observant. I began to anticipate exactly when he would arch his back or when he was about to pounce. This didn’t happen overnight; it was the result of daily shooting.</p>
<p>Really take the time to be a quiet observer of your surroundings and your subject. This will allow you to anticipate photographable moments rather than frantically seeking them. Be a student of your subject, your home, and your camera and you are sure to grow as an artist.</p>

<p>Having someone there to help direct your subject can relieve a lot of the stress of daily shooting and can make others just as invested in your project as you are! They, too, can become active observers and can assist you with individual shots as well as help you with anticipating those moments and activities worth photographing.</p>

			<p>For the most part, I shot images of my kitten alone – exploring the world on his terms. Sometimes, I included other family members in the story. I was sure to document the time we took our kitten on a fifteen hour road trip – in a van – to Grandma’s house. He even got to experience snow for the first time!<i></i></p>
<p>Just because you have committed to shooting the same subject daily doesn&#8217;t mean that you can ONLY shoot that subject daily. Including other people/items in the frame can add to the story of your subject and can help add important details to your narrative.</p>
<p>Break-up the monotony of photographing the same thing every day and keep yourself fresh and motivated by adding extra elements to your shooting project.</p>

			<h1>Editing and Artistry</h1>
<p>Using creative editing techniques is one of my favorite ways to add further interest to my photographs. Just when you think you have run out of ways to depict a single subject, you have overlays and textures in Photoshop to play with! Don&#8217;t be afraid to explore techniques outside of your normal style in the name of artistic growth.</p>
<p>In this edit, I imagined that my house cat was really a wild cat at heart. I photographed him under my dining room table and then created some overlays using photos I’d previously shot of bamboo and ferns for a jungle effect.</p>

			<p>Shooting a single subject daily is a personal project that ANYONE can do! All you need to get started is your camera and a (reasonably willing) subject.</p>
<p>Be certain that your chosen subject isreadily available to you every day. If you have pets or young children in your home, they are perfect for a project like this!</p>
<p>If you don’t have kids or pets, there are plenty of other options. You could choose a house plant or a tree in your yard. You could shoot the changing scene out the same window every day. You could even photograph your breakfast each morning!</p>
<p>The possibilities are truly endless and it is up to you to identify the perfect subject for you.</p>
<p>Allow the sameness of your subject to push your creativity. I know you will be thrilled with where your project takes you!</p>

			<p>I’ve fallen in love with high contrast black and white images.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to share with you how I get this look!</p>
<p>When converting to black and white, all images aren’t created equal. Certain images just seem to shine in black and white.</p>
<p>When choosing images to edit in a high contrast black and white style, look for images with lots of contrast. You want really bright areas and really dark areas.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your use of light. Strong directional light, patches of hard light, rim light, and backlight give you bright brights and dark shadows.</p>
<p>Contrast can also come from a wide tonal range. Images with mostly middle gray won’t have a big emotional and visual impact.</p>

			<p>Once I’ve selected my photo, I do my black and white edit in Lightroom.</p>
<p>Now here’s a secret that not many people know. I start all my black and white edits with a preset. Casablanca available in the Cinema Presets Sampler is my go-to preset. It&#8217;s where I start all my black and white edits.</p>
<p>In the following video, I walk you through a high contrast black and white edit, starting with the Casablanca preset. I’ll show you how I make an image really pop by tweaking the preset to fit my own personal vision.</p>
<p>One caveat. When I was videoing this edit, I often couldn’t get my mouse to line up perfectly with what I was saying. So if I say, “Increase exposure +25,” and you notice that my mouse had a mind of its own and landed on +26, please don’t worry. For the sake of time, I considered that close enough and just kept going.</p>
<p>Also, to save time, I cropped and straightened the image before starting the video.</p>

			<p>In review, here are the steps I took in this edit:</p>
<ol>
<li>I selected, cropped, and straightened the image.</li>
<li>I adjusted the exposure and white balance and moved the shadow slider to the right.</li>
<li>I applied the Casablanca preset.</li>
<li>After applying the preset, the shadows were still too dark so I moved the shadow slider further to the right.</li>
<li>I used radial and graduated filters to direct the light in the image.</li>
<li>I moved the clarity slider all the way to +78. Clarity is one of my go-to adjustments for high contrast black and white edits.</li>
<li>I played with the color sliders. I moved the orange slider right to brighten her skin. I also moved both the yellow and green sliders to the right just a bit to brighten the grass and trees. Color sliders are another big way I up the contrast in my black and white edits.</li>
<li>Sharpening: Amount +52, Masking +92.</li>
<li>Noise Reduction: Luminance +31.</li>
<li>I removed the grain added by Casablanca.</li>
<li>I moved the dehaze slider to the right just a bit.</li>
</ol>
