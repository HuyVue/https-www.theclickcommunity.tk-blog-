			<p>Photography is one of the most enjoyable forms of art and there is no shortage of reasons why. From traditional portrait work to completely abstract, the possibilities of how and what we shoot are endless.</p>
<p>Regardless of the subject matter you prefer, all of us begin at a similar place. We have to learn from the ground up. The photography journey is full of experimentation. Growth is dependent upon testing out the waters and taking risks.</p>

			<p><em>Color balance</em> in digital photography is simply the correct rendering of colors. With correct color balance, grey is neutral, white is white, black is black, and so on throughout the rainbow.</p>
<p>When a photo’s color balance is off in a photo, our brains are trained to correct it. This how we know that the grass is green (even if there is too much magenta in the photo), the sky is blue (even if the photo is too warm), and a red shirt is in fact red (even when there is an overabundance of cyan in the photo).</p>
<p>However, as photographers we want to retrain our brains to see the color that is actually present. Because when you see a photo with correct color next to one with incorrect color, even our brains can’t fix that mess!</p>
<p>Learning to truly see color in photos as we edit is a honed skill. But we can practice by getting color balance right by the numbers! Practicing achieving correct color by perfecting the RGB numbers (the balance of <strong>R</strong>eds, <strong>G</strong>reens, and <strong>B</strong>lues) will allow you to gradually train your eye.</p>
<p><i>Pro tip: calibrate your monitor. Often our screens are not properly calibrated and this can mean what we see on screen will not look like what we seen when our images are printed.</i></p>
<p>Eventually, you will be able to see correct color straight away and will only need to check your numbers occasionally. This will make for more pleasing skin tones and more realistic representations of any scene you want to capture.</p>

			<p>Too much sharpening is a classic newbie error. When used correctly, the sharpen tool can be incredibly powerful. It makes images POP! and enhances them with a more three-dimensional feel.</p>
<p>But here, the saying, “Too much of a good thing” most definitely applies. When a newer photographer gets a little too excited about sharpening, we start to see images that look “crunchy” and subjects that look almost alien. And that’s not good!</p>
<p>Over-sharpening can happen to an entire image, but oftentimes photographers will focus on their subject’s eyes. A bit of clarity on the eyes can really draw your viewer into your subject’s gaze. But taken too far and then suddenly we are looking into a pair of alien eyes!</p>
<p>If you are guilty of this, don’t apologize. So many of us have been there before. My best advice is to edit your photo and then reduce the effect by 10%. Walk away from your computer screen and then come back. Do you like what you see? Then that’s probably a good place to land.</p>
<p>With a little awareness and a fine tuned eye you will have your sharpening skilled sharpened in no time.</p>

			<p>Much like sharpening, skin smoothing is one of those tricks that is so exciting that it is easy to find yourself getting carried away. One minute you think you are diminishing blemishes and the next you have made your subject look like a plastic doll!</p>
<p>With skin smoothing, a little goes a long way. When your grandma Mable’s face closely resembles a baby’s bottom, this may be your cue to back off a bit. Just like with sharpening, you should err on the side of too little smoothing rather than taking it too far.</p>

			<p>Learning that we can adjust color intensity in post processing is a game changer. Who doesn’t want to pop color and enhance visual appeal to their image?!</p>
<p>But bad things happen when we take that too far. When colors are <i>out of gamut</i> they are beyond our working color space. We lose detail in that particular color. Losing detail in our image is no bueno. This means that they won’t render correctly on the screen or in print.</p>
<p>You can turn on warning signals in both Lightroom and Photoshop that will alert you when colors are out of gamut. Keep these on and pay attention to your <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/how-to-read-a-histogram-7-examples-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">histogram</a> to be sure that you aren’t taking your saturation and vibrance too far.</p>

			<p>Adding too much contrast to your image can result in the loss of detail. Highlights can blow out (meaning there is no longer detail in your whites) and shadows can clip (meaning there is no longer detail in your blacks).</p>
<p>Similarly to blowing color channels, excessive contrast can cause issues both on a screen and in print. Those spots of too-white and too-black can pull your viewer&#8217;s eye away from the important aspects of the frame. And the contrast in colors can leave things looking unrealistic and jarring.</p>
<p>While you should definitely aim to have a good range of tones in your photos (perhaps especially in a black and white edit), you want to be sure that you aren’t pushing the limits too far.</p>

			<p>The current DSLR cameras have incredible capabilities. At times it can be tempting to depend on our post processing to correct our in camera inadequacies.</p>
<p>But take caution when lifting shadows on an underexposed image. At first glance it may not be glaring, but relying too much on editing to “save” an image can create unwanted noise and artifacts.</p>
<p>What are noise and artifacts? These are the little specks that you see throughout the image (especially in the shadows in digital photography as illustrated in the image above). This really reduces the overall image quality and will diminish details. The key is to get correct exposure in camera so that you don&#8217;t need to adjust the exposure too much when editing.</p>

			<p>Actions and presets are very popular and readily available. Sometimes when using this shortcut for batch editing you can save a tremendous amount of time. That’s a good thing!</p>
<p>An important factor to keep in mind the most actions are not one size fits all. While some can be used on occasion for global adjustments, it’s very important to make sure that local adjustments can be made. This will allow you to tweak things for your particular photo and remove the effects of the action in select areas should it not work in one part of the frame.</p>
<p>At anytime during the editing process you are unsure if your action or preset has gone too far, check with the original image and compare. Often this little break will help tremendously. If you still aren’t sure, sleep on it or let someone else compare the two and give you an opinion.</p>

			<p>Now that you have a solid understanding much of what you want to avoid when editing your photos, truth be told, making these mistakes is how we learn. While making errors can often feel like failure, they are actually secret signs that help send you in the right direction as you continue to grow.</p>
<p>All of the photographers featured here made <em>all</em> of these mistakes. Over the years, they learned how to harness the power of editing and use it to enhance their photos rather than detract. <em>A special thank you to everyone who offered-up their early work to use as examples of what not to do!</em></p>
<p>Allow experimental editing to help you understand the power of each tool and how much of it you are comfortable using in your own work. Every step of this journey is just as important as the next. While the destination can be rewarding, the true fulfillment comes from enjoying the entire process. Happy editing!</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s just not practical to lug around our dSLR cameras everywhere we go.</p>
<p>But we rarely travel anywhere without our phones these days. They are like a lifeline to most of us.</p>
<p>So when a spontaneous and meaningful moment arrives, we snap away with our smartphone. Which is exactly why I love finding vendors who make it easy to print from our phones or Instagram accounts.</p>
<p>You may have some of the same questions I did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who do I choose?</li>
<li>And how will the print quality look?</li>
<li>What is a reasonable price?</li>
<li>There are so many options out there&#8230;where do I start?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the past couple months I experimented with different companies so I can share my experiences with you. The following are my three of my favorites:</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.persnicketyprints.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persnickety</a></h2>
<p>This darling vendor based in Utah has a wide variety of services including photo books, cards, and calendars.</p>
<p>I was drawn to them for their small prints which can be ordered directly from your Instagram account. In fact, you can print from any platform.</p>
<p>These photos all come with a white border and are available in several different square sizes ranging from 5&#8243;x5&#8243; to as small as 3&#8243;x3&#8243;. They also have the most adorable 3&#8243;x4&#8243; Retro Prints, which will satisfy your Polaroid feels.</p>
<p>When I received mine in the mail I was giddy. The quality and color are beautiful. The shipping is a flat rate of $5.99 or $15 if you are shipping internationally.</p>
<p>The turnaround for these prints was lighting speed. I received them within several days of ordering. I have definitely enjoyed purchasing some of Persnickety&#8217;s other products as well, such as their scrapbook pages. They also like to spread a lot of kindness around, so I dig that too.</p>
<p>I am so glad to have this company in my repertoire. Take a look for yourself.</p>

			<h2>2. Parabo Press</h2>
<p>I was extremely excited to discover this company who creates their prints at their shop in Mumbai.</p>
<p>They take pride in delivering to customers world wide. Their ordering approach is very different from others I’ve encountered.</p>
<p>They offer their square prints at no fee but then charge if you choose to upgrade from 4 inch to 5.5 inch prints. They also charge for shipping starting at $8 for economy, which takes 12-15 days.</p>
<p>At first I was a bit unsure that I wanted to wait two weeks for my prints to arrive if I went the least expensive/economy shipping option but after I saw the final product I quickly decided it was well worth the wait.</p>
<p>One thing to consider with this company is that you need to be prepared to upload and order your prints in one sitting because the system does not save your partial projects. The print color and quality are impressive.</p>
<p>If you are not is a hurry to receive your order and are prepared to upload and order right away, Parabo Press has incredibly beautiful prints. Bonus: Their square and classic prints are printed on 100% recycled paper.</p>

			<h2>3. <a href="https://www.artifactuprising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact Uprising </a></h2>
<p>Artifact Uprising is a definite favorite of mine. I am sold on them not only because of their beautiful, contemporary products but also because they use 100% post-consumer-waste paper, and exclusively dead-fall beetle-kill pine for their wood products. It&#8217;s a double win-they are gorgeous and green.</p>
<p>Artifact also uses acid free archival paper and press printing so their prints are meant to last.</p>
<p>I have never been disappointed. I&#8217;ve ordered photo books, postcards, calendars and prints with their wood block as gifts and was more than pleased on each occasion. 25 beautiful, bordered, high quality, and textured matte-finished prints cost $22 + shipping.</p>
<p>You want to know a secret? If you keep your eyes peeled, every so often they have sales and usually a coupon code for 10% off.</p>

			<p>If I were to summarize what is most important for me to capture with my camera in two words it&#8217;s &#8220;honest beauty&#8221;.</p>
<p>So when I create my art it is paramount for me to communicate the authenticity of my subjects, whatever or whoever they may be. The phrase &#8220;less is more&#8221; resonates heavily with me, especially with my photography.</p>
<p>With those concepts in mind here are five simple steps I use to help cultivate a successful photo session.</p>
<h2>1.  Get to know your subjects.</h2>
<p>In order to successfully capture the essence and personalities of those you shoot, you have to know a little bit about them.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t know my subject(s) very well, I will give them a questionnaire to fill out and also make sure to chat with them on the phone or in person prior to our shoot.</p>
<p>The more we can comfortably talk during our session, the more at ease my clients will be. In turn they are more likely to be themselves in front of the camera, which is the ultimate goal.</p>

			<h2>2. Know your environment and light ahead of time.</h2>
<p>I like to visit a session location a few day ahead of time, if I am able. I have found that my favorite sessions are the ones that I let unfold naturally.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t do much directing with my subjects, I like to have as much control over my environment as possible.</p>
<p>On the day I stake out my location, I walk through where I want to be and at approximately what times. I take notes on my phone so that I can reference them on the day of the shoot.</p>
<p>Then on the day of my session I don&#8217;t have to over think and I can just focus on capturing those special connections and moments.</p>
<h2>3. Minimize your equipment.</h2>
<p>I like to keep my gear simple. The less I have to pack around, the more I can focus on what is most important. I choose one or two lenses and pack a light backpack with a few necessary items.</p>
<p>I always leave room for client&#8217;s keys, kid&#8217;s snacks, blankets or other small items. This will help keep them hands free as well.</p>

			<h2>4. Take your time.</h2>
<p>Your session is not a race. In fact, the more we rush, the more our anxiety can climb which tends to stunt our ability to tap into our creativity.</p>
<p>Arrive early and take time to relax a bit before your shoot. Sip on a coffee, listen to your favorite song, and give yourself time to walk around for a few minutes before your clients arrive. This will set the tone for your session.</p>
<h2>5. Be yourself and have fun.</h2>
<p>If you are prepared, you are more likely to relax and enjoy yourself. Be silly, play music, and tell jokes during the in between moments.</p>
<p>Your clients will feed off of your energy and you will feel that energy in your final work.</p>

<p>Well hello! In this peek, I will not be bedazzling you with impressive amounts of equipment or fancy accessories, but I am going to share my simple set up and the photography related items that I treasure dearly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32081 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-5d-classic-camera.jpg" alt="Canon 5d classic camera" width="640" height="478" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-5d-classic-camera.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-5d-classic-camera-310x231.jpg 310w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-5d-classic-camera-216x160.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>1. First up is my beloved third hand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-5D-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B0007Y791C" target="_blank">Canon 5D classic</a>. I think this camera is incredible and when it&#8217;s days are through I will probably replace it with another of its liking.  It&#8217;s my one and only dSLR camera and that is exactly why the image above is from my iPhone 4.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.modstraps.com/" target="_blank">Mod camera strap</a>:  I purchased this little gem right after I received my 5D.  It&#8217;s been on my camera ever since.  I do have Czarina&#8217;s Project camera straps on my wish list though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32082 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-50mm-f1.4-lens.jpg" alt="Canon 50mm f1.4 lens" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-50mm-f1.4-lens.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-50mm-f1.4-lens-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>3. The <a href="http://www.adorama.com/CA5014AFU.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Canon 50mm f/1.4</a> had me from hello.  This lens has been my tried and true since photography and I met.  Did I say I love it?  That is definitely not a secret.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/product-review-tamron-24-70mm-lens/" target="_blank">Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8</a>:  I recently added this to my collection and it has opened up a new world of diversity to my work.  The two lenses together meet all my current photography needs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32083 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-camera-bag.jpg" alt="Canon camera bag" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-camera-bag.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Canon-camera-bag-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>5. This basic Canon camera bag was given to me when I purchased my camera.  I have wanted a Ketti bag for years, but honestly it would just sit pretty in my house or car (which I do not mind one single bit). I don&#8217;t usually carry my bag when I&#8217;m shooting.  I like to be hands free if I can and load up my pockets with back up batteries, an extra memory card, and my car keys. If  I do take my bag with me, it ends up in dirt and thorny weeds and no place a pretty bag should go. That&#8217;s why this plain old bag suits me perfectly.</p>

<p>7. My name tag from my the very first annual <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/clickinwalk/" target="_blank">Clickin Walk</a>. I can&#8217;t seem to part with it.  I keep it tucked away in my bag.</p>

<p>9.  I never leave the house without cherry Chapstick. It&#8217;s a staple for me.</p>
<p>10.  <a href="https://www.unitprints.com/" target="_blank">Unitprints cards</a>:  I recommend them to those who want to print my images.  I&#8217;ve always been very pleased.  For my own everyday prints I use their sister site, <a href="http://www.colorincprolab.com/" target="_blank">Color Inc</a>.</p>

<h4>5 things about Heather</h4>
<ol>
<li>I count my blessings every single day.</li>
<li>Motherhood is the greatest joy of my life and it makes me enjoy those quiet peaceful moments alone that much more.</li>
<li>I almost always have fresh flowers in the middle of my kitchen table.  They make me happy.</li>
<li>Although I seem to always have a load of laundry running, I think I may have the world&#8217;s largest laundry pile ever.</li>
<li class="size-full wp-image-30953 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;">I love to sing and dance even though I&#8217;m not great at either.  Usually I don&#8217;t care.  We pretty much live in a musical around our house.  Some days I feel like half our conversations include the verse from a song.  If we were in person right now I would likely burst out into a very Frozen inspired, &#8220;Okay bye&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/tag/our-favorite-things" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My favorite things</a> with <a href="http://www.heatherlphotography.com/" target="_blank">Heather Lazark</a>!</p>
<p>My true favorite things are the people I love and the time we spend together. But let’s face it, beyond that we all have those tangible “things” that make our day a bit happier.  The little things in life are what I appreciate most.  It is tough to narrow down, but here are ten every day simple things that make my days a little brighter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30199 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tulips-picture-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="tulips picture by heather lazark" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tulips-picture-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tulips-picture-by-heather-lazark-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>1. Fresh flowers absolutely light up my day.  I especially love to pick them up at our local farmers market.  If I don’t make it there, my second favorite place to purchase seasonal flowers is Trader Joe’s.</p>
<p>2. I am incredibly captivated by children’s art.  Of course my favorite artists are my own little ones and I display their art all over our walls.  I have the neatest frames that show off their precious work.  The best part about them is that they also have secret storage inside.  So when my budding Picassos make something I love, all I have to do is write the date on the back and conveniently place their piece inside the frame.  I was unable to find the link to the one I have but I did find a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Child-Artwork-Frame-DaVinci-Masterpieces/dp/B000IF7JYC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392355808&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=art+frames+with+storage" target="_blank">similar frame here</a>.</p>
<p>3. Crossfit.  I do not get into my gym nearly enough but when I do it is all out crazy tire flipping dripping sweat release time.  I need it. I crave it. It makes me feel alive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30194 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clarisonic-photograph-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="clarisonic photograph by heather lazark" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clarisonic-photograph-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/clarisonic-photograph-by-heather-lazark-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.clarisonic.com/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Clarisonic</a>:  This is one of my favorite beauty items. Using it is the only way my skin really feels clean.  I’ve had mine for over six years and it’s as much a part of my daily routine as brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>5. I would marry my <a href="https://secure.vitamix.com/6300.aspx" target="_blank">Vitamix</a> if I could.  I use it at least several times every day.  I have so many favorite concoctions I like to make but one that I mix up every morning, even for the kiddos, is a green drink.  Here is my favorite recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 stalks of celery</li>
<li>an extra-large handful of kale</li>
<li>one inch piece of fresh ginger</li>
<li>juice from half a lemon</li>
<li>2 small apples (cored)</li>
<li>one whole orange (peeled)</li>
<li>I mix all ingredients on the “smoothie” setting and then strain through a nut milk bag.  I feel like it rejuvenates every cell in my body.  It’s such a great way to begin the day. And this is a great segway to my next item.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30197 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lemon-squeezer-photo-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="lemon squeezer photo by heather lazark" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lemon-squeezer-photo-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lemon-squeezer-photo-by-heather-lazark-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OTC-70417-Yellow-Lemon-Squeezer/dp/B000A7S636/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392434835&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lemon+squeezer" target="_blank">Lemon squeezer</a>:  This is one of those items that I wish I had invented.  It’s genius. I use lemons every day, so this is very well loved in our house.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30195 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/etsy-purse-pic-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="etsy purse pic by heather lazark" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/etsy-purse-pic-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/etsy-purse-pic-by-heather-lazark-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>7. I LOVE my purse.  It was handmade by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/christystudio?ref=shopsection_shophome_leftnav" target="_blank">Christystudio on Etsy</a> and I’m so fond of it that after five years of daily use, I had her custom make me another one.  I think I may just stock up on them in case she changes careers. Not kidding… I love this bag.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/click/" target="_blank">Click magazine</a>: It is incredibly exciting and a bit surreal for me to sit down with one of my favorite magazines that happens to be filled with articles, stories, and images from so many of my favorite people and friends.  I treasure my quiet time with a cup of coffee and Click!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30198 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sewing-picture-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="sewing picture by heather lazark" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sewing-picture-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sewing-picture-by-heather-lazark-310x146.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>9. My sewing machine was passed down to me by my mom and although I am not nearly as gifted as she is, I try to find time to spend with it.  One of my goals this year is to make a quilt for each of my girls.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-30196 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hiking-photo-by-heather-lazark.jpg" alt="hiking photo by heather lazark" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hiking-photo-by-heather-lazark.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hiking-photo-by-heather-lazark-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="size-full wp-image-30953 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;">10. Hiking on our local nature trails with my favorite people is high on my “favorites” list.  There is nothing that quite compares to getting out into Mother Nature for a big dose of perspective.  The sounds, the smells, and the beauty away from the busyness of life are fuel for my soul.  This is also where I find much of my photographic inspiration.</p>

			<p>My love affair with photography began like many others here at <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickin Moms</a>, during the anticipation of my first child.</p>
<p>Clearly, the art and I were destined for life.</p>
<p>At that same time I drastically cut back on work, to be home more, leaving me with very little financial freedom. And as you all know, photography is not an inexpensive hobby.</p>
<p>With very little money and a passion that would not die, I found myself in a bit of a conundrum.</p>
<p>I was determined to pursue photography, even on a serious budget. I pledged that I would not let my modest equipment hold me back, regardless of what gear I thought a photographer was “suppose” to have.</p>
<p>This is my art, my passion, and photography has a piece of my soul. So I committed to learning as much as I possibly could and to work around my obstacle.</p>

			<p>You may be wondering what I mean by having modest equipment.</p>
<p>Well, I started out with a Canon Rebel and after saving for over a year I managed to purchase a used 5D classic from a friend. Beyond that, I only have one lens.</p>
<p><strong>Yep, that’s right. One lens.</strong></p>
<p>My 50 1.4. Yikes, this feels a bit like confession time.</p>
<p>Now I’m not going to lie, I would be nothing short of incredibly grateful to have another lens but it’s simply not in the cards for me right now. So I make it work.</p>
<p>In fact, I more than make it work, I secretly love having one lens, and here are some reasons why&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>When I get ready to shoot, whether it be a planned session or a spontaneous moment around the house, I don’t have to spend time trying to decide which lens to use. It’s already set up, ready to go on my camera. Nor do I have to take the time to change my lens, which might cause me to miss a moment I might not otherwise capture. By eliminating lens choice as a variable, I can really focus on other important elements such light, perspectives, and framing to create my vision.</li>
<li>I’m a bit of a minimalist. I like things simple. When I go out on a shoot all I carry is my camera and a light back pack. Instead of toting around a camera bag full of lenses and other equipment, I keep my arms free for one thing only, my camera. This helps reduce distractions for me and helps me get into my creative brain.</li>
<li>Because I only have one lens, I know it inside and out. I have learned to use my camera settings and my quick-moving feet to help me create all of my visions from my little 50 1.4. I have never felt limited when it comes to variety in my photos. I feel the possibilities are infinite, even with just one lens. Indoor, outdoor, close-up, detail, distance, landscape, everyday, hospital newborn, food, parties, selfies; I shoot them all.</li>
</ol>

			<p>There are those infrequent moments when someone asks me which lenses I use that a small part of me feels like I have novice written on a sticky attached to my forehead.</p>
<p>Although I will always have room to grow, I quickly remind myself of my photography journey and how far I have come. I have not gotten to where I am today because of fancy equipment. I have arrived here because of my passion.</p>
<p>My goal is to inspire one impassioned photographer out there who is in a position like mine, to never hold back because of it. Or even remind a seasoned expert that sometimes less is more.</p>
<p>Van Gogh made masterful paintings using just one medium, you too can make magic with “just one lens”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several months ago my computer crashed and I was without it for a solid week.  That meant no uploading, no editing, and I can hardly bear to say it&#8230;no Clickin Moms.  It was absolute torture.  During that time I realized how truly integral photography has become in my life and how much I appreciate and depend on this community.  I also found myself with a lot of time freed up, much more than I&#8217;d like to admit.  Motherhood has brought me endless joy.  I have always loved photography; and CM was the gift I found during their fusion.  CM had me from &#8220;hello&#8221; and has become my home away from home.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it; we have a special thing going on here at Clickin Moms.  We are like a great big extended family in many ways.  I&#8217;m certainly not saying it’s all unicorns and rainbows around  here.  Of course we have our share of differences.  And there is no shortage of strong, honest opinions. A sure way to get the heat turned up is to bring up the old natural light vs. flash argument or innocently ask whether you should take money if you are not in &#8220;business&#8221;.  And our differences don&#8217;t stop there.   We come from all over the world; you might find one Clickin Mom living the island life on an isle in the Indian Ocean and another awaiting a tornado warning in a small town in Kansas.   Some of us like the look of a more processed image and others prefer to keep it &#8220;clean&#8221;.  Some of us have a longstanding successful business and others are driven by simply capturing everyday moments of our children.</p>
<p>Although our diversity is grand, our commonalities most definitely prevail.   We are women, we are mothers, and we are photographers.  We share, we teach and we inspire.  There is a passion here that is unique to us, that creates camaraderie, and that only we truly understand.  And it&#8217;s pretty powerful.   So during my computerless week, I cleaned up piles of mess, did a lot of laundry, and thought about what it means to me to be a Clickin Mom.  Here is what I came up with.  I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p><em>You know you are a Clickin Mom when&#8230;</em><br />
you can never get enough of little toes and you are obsessed over eyelashes.</p>

your house is in shambles, the kids are starving but you are totally on top of who submitted the latest picture share.</p>

you risk waking your light sleeping toddler during the only time of the day you have to regain your sanity, just so you can capture a sweet sleeping photo.</p>

the tiniest things your children do become captured treasures.</p>

<p><em>You know you are a Clickin Mom when&#8230;</em><br />
you might forget your purse when you leave the house, but never your camera bag; and it&#8217;s even more likely that your camera bag IS your purse.</p>

<p><em>You know you are a Clickin Mom when&#8230;</em><br />
you repaint the color of your entire kitchen so that its complimentary when you photograph your children.</p>
<p><em>You know you are a Clickin Mom when&#8230;</em><br />
you don&#8217;t know the date, you don&#8217;t know the time, but you always know when its golden hour.</p>
