<p>Two years? Maybe ten?</p>
<p>What is it called after 85?</p>
<p>I’d say it goes beyond a tradition and is something in and of itself to be celebrated. However, after 8-decades, the focus of my family’s Fourth of July reunion isn’t glorifying that it is still going strong after all this time … the focus has always remained the same … freedom and family.</p>

<p>It began back in 1930 when the first Fourth of July picnic was held at my great-grandparents’ beach property in Port Ludlow, Washington.  Back then, the gathering was a bit smaller but the piece of land, the Puget Sound, the beach, and the reason … it was all the same.  They gathered out of thankfulness, in gratitude for all they had as Americans.  Yes, they were staring down the tunnel of what would become the Great Depression, but still, they had freedom and family to celebrate and that was the perfect reason to start gathering together on the Fourth of July each year.  Five generations later as we still gather in this way, we continue to embrace what not only makes our family ours, but our nation ours.</p>
<p>The family has grown and the tradition has expanded from a pot-luck picnic to a multi-day, full-fledged, camping extravaganza. We camp for days, gather around the campfire, and wander the beach in search of as much sea glass as possible.  Over 100 family and friends gather for the foundation of the event … the pot-luck picnic that includes clam-chowder made from scratch, barbecued salmon, and home-made vanilla ice cream and so much more.  The kiddos play in the Sound and the adults reminisce about the years when they too were so young and carefree and swam in the very same frigid salt-water. We roast s’mores, play cards and corn-hole, and watch remarkable firework shows from our next-door neighbors and others all around the Hood Canal.  We worship, we connect, we relax … we feel like time is standing still.  I have celebrated the Fourth of July here for all but one of my 33 years and yet somehow the history that weaves through this gathering never ceases to amaze me.  And now, I get to see my own children reliving the memories I carry from my own childhood of enjoying this tradition.</p>

<p>So.  When I began studying photography I immediately looked forward to combining my love for documenting life and my love for this family tradition by doing my best to keep its details alive in a collection of images.  My approach had to be simple yet thoughtful.  Thorough, yet unobtrusive.  Here are 6 bits of advice for achieving this when capturing your next tradition or family gathering.</p>
<h2>1. Think ahead to what elements stand-out most from your traditions…</h2>
<p>Remembering years passed, which details of your tradition are always repeated and are what you look forward to most when it comes around again?  What details define your tradition?  For me, there are SO many, but include my dad making the clam chowder, frequent walks on the beach, tables full of food for the picnic, the neighbors’ firework displays, and time at the campfire.  I knew these were images I needed to create in order to capture the core of our Fourth of July tradition.</p>

<h2>2. Commit to shooting from start to end…</h2>
<p>The story of our Fourth of July doesn’t start with the big picnic or the fireworks.  It starts with our 5 hour drive from Oregon to the Hood Canal in Washington.  When I set out to document the story of this tradition then, I had to start shooting as soon as we hit the road. Telling a complete story with documentary photography can be overwhelming and exhausting, so remember that you don’t need a whole series of images for each activity during the whole event.  For example, 12 photos of roasting marshmallows, each night, may be a bit much!  Wait for the few shots that best capture that specific element of the adventure and keep your sights on the whole trip as well as on the details.  In other words, pace yourself with your shooting.</p>

<h2>3. Keep your camera on you at all times…</h2>
<p>Investing in a reliable, comfortable camera strap is essential when it comes to photographing events such as this.  We are outside the entire time and there is action going on constantly.  If I left my camera in our tent I’d have to walk up the hill to get it and the moment would surely have passed.  And I’d be exhausted!  With my camera attached to my Black Rapid Strap I can wear it all day long and never miss a photo opportunity.  Plus, it is safe, rather than sitting on the picnic tables where little hands can easily grab it!</p>

<h2>4. Keep your gear simple, but well-rounded…</h2>
<p>I always limit my lenses when we travel, but especially for a busy, full, outdoor event such as this.  For the Fourth of July, I selected to bring just my 35mm 1.4 and my telephoto 70-200mm 2.8.  This pair gives me a well-rounded view of the activities.  From the wide, all inclusive perspective of the 35mm to the shoot-from-afar-and-zoom-in-on-the-action 70-200mm.   While I love the candid shots I can achieve with the reach of my zoom lens, the 35mm is on my camera most of the time during the Fourth of July event.  It gives the most realistic view of the scenes I’m witnessing and I find that that in turn brings us back to those moments most effectively when we revisit the images.</p>

<h2>5. Let this challenge push you…</h2>
<p>It would be easy to say “Just be thorough, don’t worry about doing your best work” when it comes to telling the story of a 4-day family tradition.  But chances are there are lots of new opportunities during the event that are different from your day to day … from the location to the light, to the people to the activities.  Even the excitement your children exude will likely be unique!  So take this time to use the light in a new way … or play with your surroundings for unique framing and use of lines … or try out a technique you don’t normally use such as a slow shutter speed to show motion.  I had so much fun using my tripod and a very slow shutter speed to capture neat shots of the fireworks show.  I also challenged myself to not be deterred by the wide range of lighting and weather we had.  And that makes the collection of images not only a record of the tradition you are enjoying, but also a display of your growing creativity and artistry.</p>

<h2>6. Share your images with those involved…</h2>
<p>After the festivities are over and I’ve edited and blogged the event I always share my blog links with the family members who attended.  I also put all the images into a Dropbox folder for those who I photographed to have access to the files if they’d like them.  This is not only my tradition, after all.  My entire family cherishes it and I want them to have images that bring the memories flooding back, too.</p>

<p>Surely, the Fourth of July will be a day that our country celebrates until the end of time.  And I cannot for-see a year when my family does not gather at our Beach House to honor all we have to be thankful for as Americans.  But as the years go on and our lives evolve and change, I know that even if this tradition does waiver our story and our love of this event will live on. Not only in our memories but in my images as well!</p>

<p>For most people, camping means getting away from it all and soaking in nature, relaxing, family-time, and living a bit primitively. But for the photographer, camping means all that and more.</p>

<p>Here are 6 thoughts to help you make the most of your photography experience when you and your family venture out into the great outdoors for your next camping adventure.</p>
<h2>1. Capture what is unique about camping</h2>
<p>From setting up your ‘home away from home’ to the activities you and your family entertain yourselves with when camping, this is what makes camping a one-of-a-kind vacation.  And this allows even the seemingly small details to have a special place in your documentation.  Strive to tell the complete story of your camping trip by starting with building the tent and snapping all the way to when your kiddos are sleeping in it.  And don’t forget to include images that break down what is both typical and distinctive to your family’s adventure.  I like to think of these details in advance and make a mental note to watch for chances to photograph them.  For my family, these details range from the food we eat, to the hikes we take, to the bows we shoot, and I try to capture snippets of each because those details all tell our story.</p>

<h2>2. Protect your gear</h2>
<p>Camping is the prime time to be thinking about protecting your gear from outdoor elements such as dirt, dust, cold, and moisture.  Utilizing a lens filter and hood is ideal to prevent damage to the lens’ glass and only changing out lenses when inside the tent is ideal to protect damage to the inside of the lens and camera body.  Storing your gear overnight can also pose a bit of a challenge when the temps dip and dew coats everything.  When I can, I like to keep my camera and lenses zipped up in my camera bag and locked in our car, but nestled into my suitcase surrounded by my clothes, and stored in our tent, is a safe option too.  Regardless, I always keep a few silica gel packs in my camera bag to ward off any moisture that may be present.  And when you’re using your gear, protect it by making sure it is securely attached to a trust-worthy, comfortable camera strap.  I have been using my Black Rapid Strap for 4 years now and never step outside to shoot without it.  And it is perfect for camping trips because it keeps my camera close and is also totally comfortable for long stretches of wear.</p>

<h2>3. Keep your gear simple</h2>
<p>As backwards as it sounds, there are a lot of complexities to deal with while camping despite our best efforts to temporarily live primitively. So, help yourself out by keeping your camera gear simple.  I try to stick with one, maybe two, lenses.  I always take my 35mm for its storytelling abilities and perhaps a longer lens, such as the 70-200mm.  I generally forgo my grey card, tripod, speedlight and the like to just travel lighter.  However, selecting a backpack camera bag designed for outings such as camping and hiking will accommodate these items and make organizing and carrying them much easier.  I love my <a href="http://www.lowepro.com/slingshot" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Lowepro Slingshot Backpack</a> for this purpose.  For simplicities’ sake, though, I prefer utilizing Kelvin for white balance, my children, husband or stumps to allow me to get into the frame, and lanterns and flashlights for low light shooting.</p>

<h2>4. Play with the unique light and compositions</h2>
<p>Yes, I love camping for all that “camping” entails, but more and more, I love it just as much for the opportunity to photograph someplace totally new and challenging.  Spending all day in the outdoors presents countless opportunities to study and use light and environment in ways that may not be overly familiar or within your comfort zone.  Embrace that!  Look for lines and framing options among the trees and paths.  Seek deep shadows and pockets of light when the sun is high and gorgeous filtered light when it is rising or setting.  Enjoy having the time and freedom to experiment with these elements and your perspective while you observe your children playing baseball with sticks and pine-cones or making a crown out of wildflowers.  Camping is the perfect time to let loose, try something new, slow down and study your surroundings and play with your photography.</p>

<h2>5. Embrace the often considered ‘less-than-desirable’ side of camping</h2>
<p>Awe, yes.  For me it is always the dirt.  For you it may be the wind that won’t stop blowing or the rain that insisted on coming along.  Maybe it is even the overly tired children or the bug bites.  Believe it or not, you’ll laugh about those less than desirable details someday and the images will not only help tell the complete story, but will help you be grateful that they are a memory and you’re not currently dealing with those challenges.  They may also help remind you not to make the same mistakes again (like forgetting the bug spray) or to take certain steps to avoid particular issues (like remembering to bring only hiking shoes rather than sandals to help keep little footies a bit cleaner).</p>

<h2>6. Don’t stop after dark</h2>
<p>Rarely, if ever, do my children end their camping day when the sun disappears.  On the contrary, I think this is when some of their best memories from our trips are formed.  Staying up late, playing games by the lantern or roasting marshmallows on the campfire means we are living it up, camping-style.  I know that after documenting the action all day long, not to mention after participating and caring for your crew, it can be challenging to bring out the camera at the end of the day.  But again, challenge yourself to have fun with this opportunity! Use the little bit of available light that you have to keep telling your story, right up until the last flashlight is turned off.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">**<i>This photography tutorial was posted on the ever-growing <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CM forum</a>; however, we think it&#8217;s so rad that we just had to share with you, too** </i></p>
<p>Like Goldilocks on the hunt for the perfect bed to nap in, we photographers are working to achieve the perfect exposure in our images.  Sometimes they&#8217;re too dark, sometimes they&#8217;re too bright, but with a few quick tips, you can get your exposures just right!</p>
<p>I help teach the Mastering Manual Exposure photography workshop and wrote up this tutorial on how to use your grey card to determine, not only the correct exposure for your image, but also the correct meter reading for your subject&#8217;s skin.</p>
<p>I like to try to make things simple&#8230; to take guess work out of things if I can&#8230; and this helps to do that.</p>
<p>All you need is a grey card. I have the <a href="http://amzn.to/2bOeq6q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lastolite Collapsible Grey Card</a>. I love it because it folds down small and easily fits in my camera bag, but opens to a nice 12&#8243; size.</p>
<p>You can also use a white piece of computer paper, folded over into 1/4s (just to make sure it is totally opaque), but I recommend looking into a  grey card because they are super helpful for setting your <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/white-balance-comparing-the-different-ways-to-set-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom white balance</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Meter your fray card to zero</h2>
<p>Anywho&#8230; first, I determined what the exposure would be for my &#8216;scene&#8217; and the light that shone on it.</p>
<p>I just held my grey card in the spot my subject&#8217;s face would be and metered off of the bottom, light corner to 0 because I was casting a bit of a shadow on the other areas. (If you&#8217;re using a white piece of paper, meter to +2.)</p>

<p>Next, I had my middle son sit in that spot and hovered my camera focus point over the lighter cheek (camera right).</p>
<h2>Step 3: Observe the meter reading</h2>
<p>The metering reading is just your subject&#8217;s exposure number.</p>
<p>As soon as the focus point was positioned on his cheek, I saw my meter move up to +1. THAT is his reading! I didn’t have to adjust any of my settings to take my shot, because I had already metered FOR that LIGHT off of my grey card.</p>

			<p>There you have it&#8230; I hope this helps!</p>
<p>And I want to just say this&#8230; you&#8217;ll hear the suggestion to know how to meter based on the zone system, by being able to observe where the subject/object&#8217;s tone lies in relation to middle grey. That is a fabulous, very practical and useful goal.</p>
<p>But it takes practice and time, and using a grey card like this will help get you to that goal by training your eyes to be able to see a tone and predict what it&#8217;s meter reading should be. Take out the guess work when you can.</p>
<p>I encourage you to meter off of the grey card for the light in the scene, and then hover your metering focus point on something within that scene and observe what your meter reading moves to so now you recognize what that object&#8217;s meter reading is.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re not sure of what your subject meters at, bring out your grey card and use it to help you. Do this, too, when you aren&#8217;t even caring about the shots you&#8217;re capturing&#8230; just do it for practice. I promise, it is actually pretty fun!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">**<i>This photography tutorial was posted on the ever-growing CM forum; however, we think it&#8217;s so rad that we just had to share with you, too** </i></p>
<p>I take a lot {A LOT} of photos of my boys.</p>
<p>You can see just how many <a href="http://www.laceymeyersphotography.com/blog" target="_blank">HERE</a>, on my blog!</p>
<p>I think it is as much a part of their day as eating! So, one question I receive more often than any other is “How do you get your children to cooperate??” My answer may sound a bit strange, but basically, I don’t.</p>
<p>Because my focus remains on Lifestyle Photography and capturing our life as it naturally unfolds, most of the time they are just living and I am documenting. Most of the time, all I ask of them is to continue doing what they are already doing. And they can definitely handle that!</p>
<p>However, I have found that there are certain things that have helped make my children more comfortable with having my camera pointed at them often, and having their everyday documented. And not only be <i>comfortable</i> with it, <i>but actually enjoy it!</i></p>
<h4>1. Let them just do their thing.</h4>
<p>I know! This sounds so basic! But in the midst of studying light and composition and gear and locations, it is easy to become overly focused on portraits and posing and perfection. When we’re committed to documenting the moments that will really remind us of our lives, the day-to-day activities, special details, and the unique loves our children have are what we should be sure to focus on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38129" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-vacuuming-a-table-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x609.jpg" alt="child vacuuming a table picture by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="609" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-vacuuming-a-table-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x609.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-vacuuming-a-table-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x304.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-vacuuming-a-table-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x507.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-vacuuming-a-table-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>I encourage you to make a list of things that make your day yours and your children’s childhood theirs. And then watch for opportunities to photograph these activities being lived out. You can also set them up with these favorite activities in ideal light and preferable locations, but keep it natural and make sure they feel like the focus is on their activity and your photo-taking is secondary.</p>
<h4>2. Talk them through it.</h4>
<p>When I am photographing my boys playing outside, building Legos, doing schoolwork, shooting their bows, etc., etc., I do my best to not let my desire to document interfere with their activity. I try to move myself around them in order to capture the images I’m envisioning. But there are times I will suggest that they move this way or that, or play with this toy a bit more, or position their book ‘here.’ While doing this, though, I encourage you to chat with them also about what they are playing with. Engage in their activity … don’t let your presence be all about taking their photograph.</p>

<h4>3. Encourage them to give you ideas.</h4>
<p>Children love to be involved in what we’re doing, so asking them what photographs they would like for you to take will not only encourage their comfort with your camera, but will also give you a glimpse of what they think is worth documenting.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38124" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys-building-legos-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="boys building legos picture by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys-building-legos-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys-building-legos-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys-building-legos-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys-building-legos-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4>4. Go someplace fun.</h4>
<p>This is definitely a win-win for everyone. It not only keeps life creative and fun, but it also gives our children an exciting place to explore and us a chance to document them in a different environment. I find that when my boys are at our favorite places away from home, they are even more oblivious to my camera and are more easily guided toward the pretty light or the areas that are ideal for neat compositions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38130" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-standing-in-window-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="kids standing in window pic by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-standing-in-window-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-standing-in-window-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-standing-in-window-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-standing-in-window-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4>5. Warn them.</h4>
<p>Not in the “cooperate or else way,” but simply letting them know that when they are doing their homework later, or when they are at soccer practice that evening, you’d like to take a few photos of them. This especially works with older children so they aren’t blind-sided by the big black box that suddenly appears in front of your face. If we go out on a fun adventure away from home, I tell (more like remind) my boys that I’m going to have my camera and that I’m going to take photos of them. And if I do need their cooperation for a shot or two, the quicker they go with the flow, the quicker they can be back to playing.</p>

<h4>6. Put your camera down.</h4>
<p>I think this action carries a lot more weight than we even realize. And I admit it is probably the hardest for me to embrace! But knowing when enough is enough and it is simply time to just be present is key and reminds our kiddos that it is the moment and the relationship that matters, much more than the photos do.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38128" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-studying-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="child studying photo by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-studying-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-studying-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-studying-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/child-studying-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4>7. Print your photos.</h4>
<p>When our children are able to flip through an album and see the result of our photo-taking efforts, they gain appreciation for what we do. I have watched my boys’ faces light up as they revisit our past activities in this way, and I absolutely know it helps them understand my desire to take photos of them. And when we go beyond sharing the images on Facebook or on our blogs, or storing them on our computers and actually print them, our children get to enjoy the fruits of our labor … which is the main reason we take photos in the first place, right?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38120" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-in-a-tulip-field-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="boy in a tulip field pic by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-in-a-tulip-field-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-in-a-tulip-field-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-in-a-tulip-field-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-in-a-tulip-field-pic-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4>8. Ask Them What&#8217;s Up??</h4>
<p>This is obviously more appropriate for older children, but if they act or say that they don&#8217;t like having their photos taken, ask them why not. You may be surprised at what doors this opens for you to discuss and that leads to &#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38131" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-swinging-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="kids swinging photo by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-swinging-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-swinging-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-swinging-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-swinging-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4>9. Explain Yourself&#8230;</h4>
<p>&#8230; help them understand why it means so much to you. I talk to my boys about this often from a stand-point of wanting myself and them to remember their childhood. I also talk to them about how much their Grammie LOVES to see their photos on my blog since she lives far from us AND how much their future wives and children will love to see what their life was like when they were young.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38121" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-laying-on-ground-photograph-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="boy laying on ground photograph by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-laying-on-ground-photograph-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-laying-on-ground-photograph-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-laying-on-ground-photograph-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boy-laying-on-ground-photograph-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>In addition, though, I&#8217;m honest with them and tell them that I just really, <i>really</i> like to take their photos. They know this. They know that I love it like they love Legos or riding bikes. Comparing my love of photography to something they love has really helped them understand and even support me.  They see it is more than just a camera in my face, but a passion inside me.</p>
<h4>10. Thank them.</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t emphasis this enough, and it goes along with the previous two points. Let them know how much you appreciate and enjoy their cooperation and them letting you take their photos. Er, not so much <i>letting</i> you (because we don&#8217;t want to train little kiddos to think they have the option! ) &#8230; so, just thank them. Say, &#8220;Ooooh, thank you &#8230; I love that photo I just took of you so much!&#8221; We know how good it feels to be thanked, genuinely. It goes a long way and encourages our behavior &#8216;next time&#8217;. I believe this to be true for kiddos, too. In life and in photography.</p>

<p>What tips do you have that have encouraged your children to not only put up with your photography, but to embrace it?? I&#8217;d love to hear! And if you have any questions, feel free![/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard it said that the eyes are the window to the soul.</p>
<p>And in a photograph, eye-contact holds great power in connecting the viewer to the subject. Sharp, intentional focus on the eyes plus lovely catchlights is a timeless combination and one that most of us set out to embrace early on in our photography.</p>
<p>But as my children’s photographer, I know I’m not alone in recognizing the challenge that that is time and again. As well as the limitation that always seeking eye contact can put on my storytelling.</p>
<p>Shortly after I learned what light to seek and how to nail focus, and therefore create the eye-contact shots I’d hoped for, I got tired of hearing myself say to my boys, “Please look at my camera.”  And I know they did, too!</p>
<p>It is a common question and observation that mom-togs have …. “How do I get my child to look at me for photos … the just don’t like to!”  That reality, combined with my goal of documenting real life being lived, steered me in a broader direction.</p>
<p>My solution wasn’t to abandon eye-contact images all together; they surely will always have a place in my work. But in addition to allowing myself to photograph my children just as they were, I also found myself shooting the complete opposite of eye contact: from behind. And here are some reasons why …</p>
<h2>1. It’s easier…</h2>
<p>As I’ve just mentioned, children often don’t connect with our camera lens, so it can be challenging to get them to cooperate with our desire for eye-contact photos.  Candidly shooting while they are looking away, or even encouraging them to do so, is a nice break for them from the norm.</p>

<h2>2. It’s natural…</h2>
<p>I have found that it is often my position as Mama to be walking behind my children.  At 9, 7, and 4, they are generally leading the way together, or following their dad.  They are exploring our surroundings and it is my job as their mom to be observing them and the surroundings for safety.  This means I stand back and watch, and shooting from behind embraces this.</p>

<h2>3. It’s symbolic…</h2>
<p>Similar to the statements above, the vantage point of a mother looking at her child who is looking away from her, into the distance can be very symbolic (and emotional!).  For so much of a child’s young life they are constantly looking at us, their parent, for everything.  There comes a point, though, that they begin to look outward.  To their surroundings, to their future and to the rest of the world.  Photographing your child looking away, or even walking away, is a symbolic way to honor that developing maturity.</p>

<h2>4. It connects the viewer to the environment…</h2>
<p>A photo focused on the eyes directly connects the viewer to the subject and often the surroundings fall off into bokeh oblivion.  By photographing your subject as they look away from the camera, the viewer’s attention follows their gaze.  The environment is welcomed into the photo and the viewer not only connects with the subject in the photo but also what surrounds them.  This is a powerful element in lifestyle photography.</p>

<h2>5. It is a way to deal with challenging light…</h2>
<p>Light can make or break an eye-contact photo.  Ideal light can create lovely catchlights, even skintones and flattering shadows.  However, life isn’t always happening when the light is ideal, but I believe that a cool storytelling shot can be taken in any lighting as long as you are careful about how it falls on your subject; namely striving to avoid the dreaded ‘raccoon eyes’.   Photographing from behind your subject is one way to tip-toe around the challenging light that causes these shadows that sit in the eye socket, by avoiding including the face all together.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-35751" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-in-coveralls-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="boy in coveralls photo by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-in-coveralls-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-in-coveralls-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-in-coveralls-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-in-coveralls-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>6. It is unexpected&#8230;</h2>
<p>To thoroughly tell my family’s stories, I love to create sets that include shots from many different perspectives and including a photo or two photographed from behind can add a unique, unexpected twist to the elements of the story.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-35755 size-large" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/father-and-sons-overlooking-nature-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="father and sons overlooking nature photo by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/father-and-sons-overlooking-nature-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/father-and-sons-overlooking-nature-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/father-and-sons-overlooking-nature-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/father-and-sons-overlooking-nature-photo-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>7. It can be telling…</h2>
<p>Shooting a set primarily with this perspective can also be very telling.  For example, on our recent trip to the Oregon Coast, most of my photos are taken from behind my boys because A) I stayed on the beach and they stayed in the water and B) they were very much involved in their play, and not at all with me.  If I was constantly asking them to look back at me from the water, my images could have inaccurately suggested they were concerned about what they were doing and thus seeking my approval, which sort of sadly, they were not.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-35753 size-large" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-running-on-the-beach-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg" alt="boy running on the beach picture by Lacey Meyers" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-running-on-the-beach-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-running-on-the-beach-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-running-on-the-beach-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/boy-running-on-the-beach-picture-by-Lacey-Meyers.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t always effective or ideal to rely on shooting from behind, but considering this perspective can certainly open up some doors of creative freedom and expand your photographic opportunities.  As well as take a bit of pressure off of you and your subjects by cutting back the number of times you have to say, “Okay, now look at me!”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I clearly remember first joining Clickin Moms and being so surprised by how many photographers use lenses that don’t zoom. I was completely clueless about “prime” lenses and thought they sounded mighty inconvenient! Especially when one member explained to me, “You just have to zoom with your feet”.</p>
<p>But that train of thought has stuck with me and has now significantly shaped how I shoot. I am constantly moving, changing position and perspective. And as a primarily lifestyle photographer, I have found this to be incredibly important… you must move to tell the whole story. I use this motto each time I photograph my own kids doing an activity, but today I’d love to share with you how I went about this at a recent lifestyle family session. The goal was to capture study-time.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Focus on the Subject</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Establishing the subject and activity is key, and usually the first images I capture. I typically pick the best lighting angle and begin there. I also return to this position when a new activity begins.  In this case, I started here when the little boy was reading, then came back to it when he began his writing lesson.</p>

<p><strong>2.  Change Perspective</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once I capture my ‘safe’ shots, I start to move around my subject as they go about their activity.  I want to be sure to get some shots that simulate the feeling of what they are seeing, too, not just what an observer would see.</p>

<p><strong>3.  Don’t Forget the Details</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The details are so important! On their own, these images may not have much meaning, but together with the series they play a critical role to telling the whole story. In this case, that included the little sister hiding under the table while her brother studied, the book they were reading, little sister joining in to do her own ‘studies’, and brother deciding it was time for a break.</p>

<p><strong>4.  Back – it – up</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is probably the toughest one for me, because I know I am a tight shooter. But backing up and showing the scene adds so much context to your series, as well as visual interest. This will also allow you to include details in the environment. In this case, the environment is their home and details such as the cross and map on the wall are important to include as they are meaningful to this family.</p>

<p>Some may say that I over-shoot in situations like this, as these are only a fraction of the photos I took for this family. But when it comes to documenting cherished everyday activities, I’m not sure that over-shooting is really possible!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">GIVEAWAY WINNER!</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/tag/a-peek-inside-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My photography gear</a> with <a href="http://www.laceymeyersphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lacey Meyers</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9930 aligncenter" title="Nikon camera and lenses owned by Lacey Meyers" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag1.jpg" alt="Nikon camera and lenses owned by Lacey Meyers" width="640" height="1660" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag1-119x310.jpg 119w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>1.  My <a href="http://www.kettihandbags.com/Default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KETTI camera bag</a> – I purchased this when I was just starting out and realized I wanted to take my camera everywhere with me.  For everyday outings it fits my camera, wallet, diapers and wipes perfectly!</p>
<p>2. Nikon D700 &#8211; My photography life did a happy dance when I purchased my D700.  I can’t say enough great things about this camera!</p>
<p>3.  Nikon 35mm 1.8G – This is a safety net lens for me.  It is super sharp and fast, but I pretty much only use it if I don’t quite have enough room to get the shot I’m after.</p>
<p>4.  Nikon 105mm 2.8 Macro – I think this lens is a huge creative outlet for me.  For capturing the tiniest details of a newborn to the brand-new spring growth in my gardens, this is my go-to lens.</p>
<p>5.  Nikon 85mm 1.4D – I fell in love with this lens when Kristin Ingalls used it to photograph my family, and I could see the difference in our images! Whenever I am outdoors for fun or for a session, this lens is with me all the way.</p>
<p>6.  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/NK5014AFGU.html?KBID=66976" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">Nikon 50mm 1.4G</a>  – As dreamy as my 85 is, this is my all-around-go-to lens.  Like so many others, I love this focal length and this lens is so sharp and dependable.  I use it almost exclusively for my newborns and if I had to choose only one lens to own, this would be it!</p>
<p>7.  Lens Hoods – Whenever I am shooting outdoors, I have my lens hood on.  Mostly for protection of my lens against bonking into things.</p>
<p>8.  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/LSEZYBAL12.html?KBID=66976" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">Lastolite Collapsible Grey Card</a>  – I try to always take a shot of this card to set my white balance, even when just casually photographing my kids.  This grey card is always a fun ice-breaker at sessions, too, when I literally POP it out of its case!</p>
<p>9.  First Aid stuff – this is always in my bag, though mostly because I take it everywhere and with 3 crazy little boys, it comes in mighty handy.</p>
<p>10.  R-5 BlackRapid Strap – This camera strap is such a genius invention!  It is so comfortable and makes carrying my camera a breeze.  It is easily in my top 5 greatest photography purchases!  It usually stays in my bag, though, because I remove it for shooting in my home.</p>
<p>11.  Memory Card – I always have an extra CF card in my bag! However, I do need to replace my ‘spare’ because it is one that got replaced for giving me error messages.</p>
<p>12.  LensPen – This is a pretty smart little tool for cleaning the glass on your lens.  I’ve gotten into the habit of brushing off the front of my lens before each session!</p>
<p>13.  WhiBal card – this is another safety net for me.  If I’m unsure of my WB (even if it is custom) I’ll take a photo of this card in the lighting that I’m shooting and can refer to it in post just to be sure.</p>
<p>14.  Extra Battery – I have only ran out of battery once, and that is how, when and why I acquired an extra battery.  Now, I just keep a fully charged one in my bag at all times.</p>
<p>15.  Suckers – again, mostly for my own kids, but they can come in very handy at the end of a session if I need to coax out a few more smiles from my subjects!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9931 aligncenter" title="small office area in family room by Lacey Meyers" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag2.jpg" alt="small office area in family room by Lacey Meyers" width="640" height="1126" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag2-176x310.jpg 176w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag2-363x640.jpg 363w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>My workspace is literally in the center of my home.  Moving my computer to this location made such a huge, positive impact on my photography because I was more easily able to study (ie. be on CM a LOT more!) and focus on being more consistent in my editing, while still being near my kids wherever they were in the house. This may not be a great option for everyone, but I’m so happy to have my workspace where it is!</p>
<p>16. This is where my camera usually sits.  Again, in the center of the house, easily and quickly accessible to me!</p>
<p>17.  I have recently started making lists of everything I need to do each day, on a notebook calendar.  Keeping it right next to my computer makes jotting notes about sessions, responsibilities on CM, emails that need to go out, images to be blogged, etc. very convenient.  This has majorly helped me organize all the different hats I wear.</p>
<p>18.  My space heater!  I love that thing, but more about it later.</p>
<p>19.  Dell Ultra Sharp Monitor – I recently purchased this monitor after my last one fried and was immediately impressed by its clarity, colors, appearance consistency and size!</p>
<p>20.  This basket actually holds my lenses.  Because I so often use my camera bag as a purse, I leave my lenses in the basket, in their bags, safely away from kiddo hands.  But again, easily accessible!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9932 aligncenter" title="in home photography studio by Lacey Meyers" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag3.jpg" alt="in home photography studio by Lacey Meyers" width="640" height="1660" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag3-119x310.jpg 119w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>My In-Home Studio is becoming one of my favorite spaces in my home.  I recently removed all of the furniture and left the bare bones and love the clean, fresh space that remains.  Perhaps I love it because it is where I photograph my newborns, though I often go to clients’ homes as well.   I probably should have included a photo of all that I pack for an on-location newborn session, but that could be a post all on its own.</p>
<p>21.  JC Penny Puck Beanbag – filled with quite a few extra bags of beans!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9933 aligncenter" title="must have items for newborn photography by Lacey Meyers" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag4.jpg" alt="must have items for newborn photography by Lacey Meyers" width="640" height="915" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag4.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag4-216x310.jpg 216w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bag4-447x640.jpg 447w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>While these aren’t items that you’d find in my bag, I do think they are super essential for sessions!</p>
<p>22.  Fold-up Step-stool – I found this stool at Fred Meyer after oohing and awing over one at my sister-in-law’s house.  I HAD to find one!  It is so much easier to carry around at sessions than my antique step-ladder, and much safer to stand on, too!   At newborn sessions, I set my heater on it, and also use it to get those looking-down-at-baby shots.</p>
<p>23.  <a href="http://opteka.com/opt-rf-43.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">Opteka 5-in-1 Reflector</a> – yes, a session can happen without a reflector, and I often feel like it was a waste of arm space to carry it around, yet I still take it.  A reflector can make all the difference in capturing THE shot of the session.</p>
<p>24.  Kirkland Baby Wipes – these are a no-brainer, and when I can’t fit the whole pack in my camera bag, I stick several in a ziplock baggie for easy, quick clean-ups.  Editing face messes is not my idea of fun!</p>
<p>25.  Hand Sanitizer – a must for a newborn session.   My number one way of soothing a baby is pairing the loud shhhhh-ing sound in their ear, with gently patting their bum.  If my hand touches their bum, I need sanitizer before I go picking a piece of lint off of their lip, or holding their hands in place.  A MUST.</p>
<p>26.  Ceramic Element Space Heater – I love to be warm!  And yes, it may be odd, but I love the heat from a space heater.  So this baby hangs out by my desk, and then is a key tool in my newborn sessions to keep my babies nice and warm.</p>

			<p>As a photographer who began as a scrapbooker, printing my images has always been a high priority.</p>
<p>I photograph my children as much for the future generations of our family, as I do for myself.</p>
<p>So, how they will view these images has to be considered.</p>
<p>I can hardly imagine my great-grandchildren cuddled around the computer, sorting through my external harddrives “oohing and awing” over photos of their granddaddies as children!</p>
<p>But I can most definitely see them sprawled on the floor, surrounded by organized albums, viewing and reading their stories.</p>

			<p>It is with this vision that I motivate myself to print my favorite images each month. Not just those that impress me with composition and beautiful colors and backgrounds, but those that tell the story of their life.</p>
<p>Doing this can be a daunting task if a consistent workflow is not followed from import to output. I so strongly encourage other photographers to print their personal images that I wanted to share my simple workflow here.</p>
<p>When I insert my CF card into my card reader, the images automatically open into Lightroom. Where I upload them to is critical to keeping them all organized … subfolders are my best friend when it comes to file organization!</p>
<p>My system looks like this …</p>

			<p>Pictures &gt; Year &gt; Month &gt; Activity (which describes the set of photos and is the file name)</p>
<p>And within that ‘activity,’ I will typically have three subfolders…. ‘To Edit’, ‘Print’, and ‘Web’.</p>
<p>When I export my culled/RAW processed images from Lightroom, I place them into my ‘To Edit’ folder.</p>
<p>Once in Photoshop I open those images, edit, and use Image Processor to save them into a new folder called ‘Print’. All of these images stay open in Photoshop and I will run my Web Re-size and Sharpen action.</p>
<p>Those are then saved via Image Processor into another new folder called ‘Web’. I then ‘Close-all’, being careful NOT to save all changes, and I’m done!</p>
<p>Now, when it comes time to order my prints, a simple process begins.</p>
<ol>
<li>On my desktop I will create a folder titled with the month and ‘print’ (for example, FebMarchPrint  if I’m printing images February and March).</li>
<li>I open this folder on my desktop, along with my ‘Pictures’ folder and view them both side by side.</li>
<li>Navigate to the month folder holding all of my subfolders and images from that month.</li>
<li>All I have to do is go into the subfolder ‘Print’ and Ctrl+left click on each image I want to print.</li>
<li>Once I’ve selected those to print (probably not ALL of the images in this folder) I right click on one of them to ‘copy’.</li>
<li>Paste into the ‘FebMarchPrint’ folder.</li>
<li>Then copy this folder into External Harddrive for backup.</li>
<li>I then import this file back into Lightroom, and then export right back out but changing the file size to 4x6inch and 300 dpi, into a Print subfolder within the main “FebMarchPrint” folder.  This makes the next step go a lot quicker!</li>
<li>Upload the entire ‘FebMarchPrint’ folder to your printer of choice (mine is <a href="http://www.colorincprolab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ColorInc</a>) and go from there!</li>

			<p>You may wonder how you will find the time to do this on top of taking the photos, editing the photos, and learning how to improve your photos.</p>
<p>Please trust me when I say that once you figure out an organized flow like I have outlined here it is not a daunting task, but one you can (and should!) look forward to. Seeing your images in print is amazing and is a priceless gift to your family.</p>
<p>A few more tips to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are staring at years of unprinted photos, start with your most recent and work your way back.</li>
<li>Print monthly!  Breaking it down into smaller amounts of photos will make this go much quicker.</li>
<li>Wait for your lab to have sales on their express proofs.  ColorInc often has 19 cent 4&#215;6’s that I love to take advantage of!</li>
<li>Write your To-Print date on your calendar, the same day each month.</li>
<li>Just do it.  I have to tell myself this each month and if you have to organize your prints with a child on your lap, so be it.  You’re getting it done!  Yay!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">My Photography Journey by <a href="http://www.laceymeyersphotography.com/" target="_blank">Lacey Meyers</a></p>
<p>I love bringing my photos to life in editing, finding amazing natural light, shooting wide-open, playing with depth of field, and blogging my photos. Two years ago, all of these things were foreign to me. Today, they are part of my life!</p>
<p>I ran in place for a very long time at the beginning of my photography journey. From the time I could afford my own camera and film I documented life. It was inevitable, really. I come from a line of “life-documenters.” Between my grandmother, mother, and me, we have had over 100 photo albums tracking nearly 85 years of life. So I took photos for years and remember promising myself I’d NEVER to go digital. I did not want to be like those I knew who’d gone digital, with hundreds of photos stored on memory cards and hard drives. My prints were my treasures.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6874 aligncenter" title="1" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/12.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/12.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/12-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>But the birth of my first son in 2005 resulted in too many rolls of film filled with awful images that were totally out of my control, and I succumbed to a nice little “point and shoot.” I scrapbooked my images diligently. But as I began to follow fellow scrapers’ blogs, I began noticing that my images were less than impressive. I cherished them because they were of my boys and our memories. Yet I knew they could be so much better. A common factor among the scrapbookers’ photos that I admired was the cameras they were using – DSLRs. Naturally, that was my answer. For Christmas 2008, I received my Canon XS and believed I was on my way.</p>
<p>It took me about nine months on Auto to recognize that I was still missing a huge piece of the ‘amazing photography’ puzzle. I was running in place – taking loads of photos but nothing was improving! I began reaching out to bloggers I admired. I remember leaving a comment to one of them that said, “How do you get your daughters’ eyes to look so blue? Is that in post processing?” I had no clue that my flash was the reason my boys’ true-blue eyes never shown through in my images! In December 2009, I even emailed the photographer who took my family’s photos asking her advice. I never got a response from her, or the bloggers I questioned, and thankfully realized I’d have to jumpstart this process on my own.</p>
<p>Then, on Christmas Eve 2009, my third son was born six weeks early, and we were confined to 18 days in the NICU. I was FORCED to figure out how to shoot without flash because they aren’t allowed in the NICU pods. I opened my camera’s manual for the first time sitting by his tiny isolette, determined to learn just what my camera could do and exactly how to do it so that I could capture him during his earliest days. I went back and forth between reading my Bible and my camera’s manual, finding a great deal of comfort in both.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6875 aligncenter" title="2" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/22.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="421" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/22.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/22-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6876 aligncenter" title="3" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/32.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/32.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/32-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Suddenly, my journey with photography began moving forward.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, it seemed to hit full speed when I joined ClickinMoms in January 2010. I came here via <a href="http://aliedwards.com/" target="_blank">Ali Edwards</a>’ blog and saw the images on the forum’s homepage, and I’m pretty sure I expressed my joy and excitement out loud! Those were the photos I wanted to be able to take! Upon joining, I read tutorial after tutorial, asked every question I could think of that I couldn’t find an answer for, and was NEVER made to feel ignorant. That is what stood out to me the most in my early days on CM. Every answer was as thorough as it was thoughtful and for that I was so grateful. My questions ranged from lens recommendations (I couldn’t imagine shooting with a lens that didn’t zoom!), to editing (I couldn’t imagine editing every picture!), to blogging (would anyone actually read my blog?!), and everything in between.</p>
<p>In my first several months on CM, I had multiple ah-ha moments as the technical side of photography started falling into place. The exposure triangle, toggling my focus points, and white balance became my friends. Often though, I felt like there was TOO much to learn and wondered how long it would take for all of this knowledge to come together so I would actually produce the images for which I was hoping.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6877 aligncenter" title="4" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/42.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="640" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/42.jpg 426w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/42-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>By March, I decided to enroll in a recommended workshop, hoping that would streamline all that I was learning. I found much of the information familiar but eagerly read and studied as much as possible during the course. You might have compared me to a hungry animal! Because of that course and all of my reading on Clickin Moms, I could recite so many technical facts about photography, yet my images were not improving the way I’d desired. Again, I was running in place. I was taking tons of photos daily, but had so much information running through my head that nothing seemed to be coming together.</p>
<p>I realized the only way for me to move forward with my photography was to focus on individual aspects of this art. To take a step back and slow down. To master one thing at a time, with my camera. Not just understanding it, but implementing it. As I forced myself to do this and intentionally practice with such things as exposure and metering, depth of field, composition, focus, and custom white balance, plus finding my post-processing style, my work began to evolve in the right direction. I practiced on anything and everything and my most valuable subjects weren’t always my children. A strategically placed toy is an amazing learning tool! When I completely embraced the importance of light in photography and how to accurately use it in my photos, I felt like I took a very positive turn in my journey, and I was finally moving forward. Truth be told, though, it took me nearly a year to get to that point!</p>

<p>All the while, I was also analyzing other photographers’ work. It would take only a glance at someone’s photo to know if it appealed to me, and then I would pick the image apart and draw out in my mind where their light was coming from, what their aperture probably was, and what lens they may have been using. I would decide what it was about their composition that pulled me in. I still can’t help but do this when I see images that I love, and I know this practice has helped me grow in my own work a great deal.</p>

<p>Finally, my diligence seemed to be paying off and I was genuinely excited about the photos I was taking. My time on ClickinMoms was changing from asking to answering and I genuinely enjoyed sharing any and all knowledge I had with other members. In April of 2011, I was honored to be accepted as a Mentor and into CMPro. I know I didn’t need a title to be able to do this, but I felt that with these responsibilities came my official go-ahead to give back to the CM community as much as possible. To help those who are at all stages of their journey, with the grace and patience and knowledge that so many had helped <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>But a photographer’s journey isn’t just about figuring out how to use their camera and take a good photo. It is just as much about figuring out what photography means to them and what the purpose is behind the photos they take. For me, my motivation has always been my children and capturing their memories. Not just of birthdays and big trips, but of their everyday lives. And when they look back on these photos, I don’t want them to just feel like observers. I want to transport them back so they can practically feel their experience. Like, the first time they saw snow …</p>

<p>or the captivating sight from the edge of a ferry boat …</p>

<p>I feel very blessed to have along the way, also found my love for newborn photography. I had the opportunity to photograph a friend’s 5-day old daughter and the peace I felt during the session, and the high following it, told me I’d found an additional calling with photography.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6886 aligncenter" title="13" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/13.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/13.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/13-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I’ve never felt that draw to anything else in my life. I’ve also discovered great joy in photographing maternity, babies, children and families, but capturing a newborn in those first two weeks has my heart. And just as I hope with my own personal photos, I want my clients to be able to experience the sweet miracle of their newborn baby every time they revisit their photos. This is why I pay close attention to their precious little details by incorporating macro photos into each session.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-6887 aligncenter" title="14" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/14.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/14.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/14-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Oh macro … another love I have found along my journey. Most of my work is for others – for my clients or for documenting my boys’ childhood. But my macro photography is purely for my own joy and artistic challenge. I adore capturing such finite details of God’s creation through my camera. It never ceases to take my breath away.</p>

<p>Photography is now as much a part of my days as eating and sleeping. Even when I don’t have my camera in-hand I am constantly observing the light and how it plays on my boys’ and our surroundings. And when I do have my camera in-hand? Well, I feel the special gift that is the ability to freeze time. As a whole, photography has made me slow down and appreciate my experiences, my surroundings, the changing seasons, the ups and downs of parenting, and so much more. And I very regularly blog my photos and the stories that accompany them, so that I can share my perspectives on whatever life throws my way – the joyful and not so joyful moments. Because photography has helped me find the beauty in all of it.</p>

<p>I’ve studied for countless hours, upgraded (and switched!) my equipment and editing programs, poured over amazing photography blogs, read thousands of threads on Clickin Moms, asked hundreds of questions, and received an abundance of amazingly helpful answers. That knowledge, paired with a lot of patience with myself, has been key during my journey. Two years ago I had no idea the time and effort it would take for me to capture the photos I’d dreamed of. And being me, I wanted to learn and know it all at once. But photography is not a race, it IS a journey. Slow and steady learning, and shooting with intention, and heart, and purpose has brought me here. Most definitely not to the end of my journey, but to a path that I will joyfully walking on, camera in hand, for many years to come.</p>
