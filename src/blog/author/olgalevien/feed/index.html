					<description><![CDATA[<p>I have seen artists spend hours, days, even weeks in front of the computer stressing because they can’t get the edits just right. That’s time that could be spent doing the things that you truly enjoy and creating the art you want to create. I'm here to help! These simple tips allow me to edit portrait sessions in just 20-40 minutes and weddings in 1.5-2 hours (as opposed to the almost two weeks it took me the first time!). Sticking to this workflow has given me hours back every week and has allowed me the space to enjoy every part of my photographic process.</p>

			<p>Photography is a creative outlet. It should feel truly enjoyable and rewarding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there are parts of this process that aren’t as fulfilling. They are necessary and worth the effort. Yet if they take too much time, these tasks can diminish the enjoyment we find in our photography. They can squash our creative motivation and make it more difficult for us to connect with our voice and vision.</p>
<p>To protect yourself from creative exhaustion, I am a big fan of speeding-up the processes that don’t feed your creativity. For me and so many photographers, that’s editing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>Get it right in camera</h2>
<p>This is the most effective way to save your time in post-processing. By getting your exposure right, choosing the best possible crop, dialing-in white balance, and making great choices <i>before</i> you hit the shutter button, you save yourself the time and effort of fixing these little things in Lightroom or Photoshop.</p>
<p>Look at the back of your camera and your histogram to ensure that the light is just how you want it. Watch for distracting elements in the background so that you don’t have to clone them out later. Be careful not to crop out any important components of the frame. All of these <i>can</i> be fixed in post processing, but are the kinds of mundane tasks that can quickly zap creativity.</p>
<p>Make smart, intentional choices on location to get the shots that perfectly match your vision. Don’t depend upon your editing do match the mood you want to achieve. Instead, allow it to enhance what you have captured in camera. Make editing a seamless part of the process rather than a stressful, time-consuming task to “fix” everything.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right moment</h2>
<p>It can be tempting to fire away with a digital camera. I mean, if you take a shot you don’t like you can just delete it, right?!</p>
<p>However, sifting through 500 photos of the same scene to find the one that is best is a really time-consuming task! It can be exhausting spending all that time comparing and contrasting too many nearly identical photos.</p>
<p>Instead, take your time and choose the moments you want to capture. Set your focus. Check your composition. And only hit that shutter button when you have the shot that you know you will love.</p>
<p>Of course, with fast-moving subjects you might want to take more than one photo and that’s okay! However, there is a big difference between taking an “insurance” shot and shooting indiscriminately. Be the kind of photographer who takes the former approach and you will save a ton of time in the culling process.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right time to edit</h2>
<p>If you feel like you are too emotionally invested in the session to make wise decisions immediately after the session, take a day or two off before working your way through the photos. You will have fresh eyes and won’t feel any of the nerves or frustrations that you may have experienced while shooting. Similarly, take breaks from editing as needed to keep your eyes and mind fresh and inspired.</p>
<p>The time of day that you choose to edit can make a big difference as well! Are you a morning person who feels motivated as soon as you wake-up? Then that might be the best time for you to sit in front of the computer and work through a session efficiently. Are your kids off at school during the day? Then perhaps that is the best time for you to edit as you can do so without interruptions.</p>
<p>I like to edit toward the end of the day when I have more energy and the darker conditions let me see all of my adjustments more clearly. The key is to find the time of day where you can work logically and efficiently to maximize your time and productivity.</p>

			<h2>Cull backwards</h2>
<p>Chance are, your subject is going to be most relaxed at the end of the session with more natural body language and expressions.</p>
<p>If you are taking advantage of golden hour? Your light is going to be it’s most gorgeous as the sun edges closer and closer to the horizon line.</p>
<p>I often stop shooting when I know that I got the moment just right.</p>
<p>All of this to say that there is a good chance that your best photos are going to be some of the last on your memory card. That’s why I like to cull through my images backwards, starting with those last photos from the session and working my way to the first photos.</p>
<p>Photomechanic is a great tool that I use to move through the photos quickly. It streamlines the process of organizing them, moving them into different folders, and opening them in the editing software of your choice.</p>

<p>Is anyone else here a victim of her own second guessing? When you question your decisions, you waste valuable time fretting when in all likelihood, your instincts were spot on!</p>
<p>If your edit for a photo is something a little different from what you see on Instagram but you <i>love </i>it? Then run with it! Chances are, your intuition is telling you to make the decisions that match the emotion of the moment, the personalities of your subjects, and your unique style.</p>

			<h2>Synchronize your editing</h2>
<p>When you have a set of images that are from the same session, in the same location, and in the same light, you are going to want them to look cohesive. That’s why synchronizing your editing workflow can be so helpful!</p>
<p>Instead of processing each photo individually, create your own actions and/or presets that you can adjust and apply those to your photos in batch edits. This will allow you to go through each image and tweak things so that everything is perfect while saving you a ton of time in the end.</p>

			<h2>Let go of perfection</h2>
<p>When you are editing 100 photos from one session, there is simply no way that all of them are going to be portfolio-worthy. In fact, maybe just one of them will be…if you are lucky!</p>
<p>When you are working through your post-session routine, let go of the idea that every photo should be perfect. Instead, polish every photo to be its best and then move on. You could sit forever trying to edit away every little flaw and eventually, you will burn out.</p>
<p>Embrace the fact that no one is perfect 100% of the time. Instead, find all the moments and emotions you captured and know that your clients will love them because of the memories attached to those photos.</p>

			<h2>Change the way you view editing</h2>
<p>So many photographers talk about editing as if it is a big, looming chore at the end of the photographic process. Being behind the camera is so much more fun! This makes being motivated to work on photos a process that is dreaded and avoided and often drawn-out.</p>
<p>However, if you change the way you look at editing, it may become something that you look forward to! It will become easier to work through your sessions in a timely manner, opening your schedule to the space and time you need to stay creatively motivated and inspired.</p>

			<p>At any given time of the year, you can find countless competitions with open calls for entries. Submitting for awards can allow you the opportunity for worldwide exposure and give you the satisfaction of achieving with your art. Perhaps even more importantly, entering competitions forces you to put your work out into the world by evaluating your portfolio, a practice  that will help you grow and progress as a photographer.</p>
<p>With all of the different competitions out there, it can be difficult to narrow down those that are a good fit for you and your work. Whether it be a gallery competition, a blog contest, social media exposure, or anything else, I am here to help you know which contests are right for you how to prepare for them. With these tips and tricks, your submissions will go smoothly and you will increase your chances of winning!</p>

			<h1>1. Read the contest terms &amp; conditions</h1>
<p>Take the time to know all the details. What subjects and categories is your contest searching for? What kinds of freedoms or restrictions do you have in editing? (Some creative categories allows textures, layers, etc., while others not allow even minor cloning work.) Does the competition have guidelines for image file sizes? Is there a limit to the number of images you may submit? Are there feed associated with participation? What is the deadline for submitting your images?</p>
<p>When I find a competition that I know I want to participate in, I add the deadline to my Google calendar. This way, I get alerts that will keep me updated as various deadlines approach and I am sure not to miss an opportunity. You can also sign-up for email updates from some competitions and they will keep you updated as the submission cutoff nears.</p>

			<h1>2. Evaluate your portfolio and choose your best images</h1>
<p>Take a look at past winners of the competition and see if you can find any patterns in their photographs. Then look at your own work. Find strong images that you think would fall in line with the aesthetic preferences of the competition. Subject matter, processing style, use of light and countless other variables come into play when judging a competition and you want to be sure to speak to this specific audience. More than anything, submit work of which you are proud and trust your gut when narrowing down photos for any contest.</p>

			<h1>3. Choose your WOW pictures</h1>
<p>After your first look through your portfolio, revisit your selections. Determine which photos have that WOW factor that you know will leave an impression on the judging panel. Will your artwork stand out amongst the others in the competition?</p>
<p>Before choosing my final submissions, I look at my images in a grid. This technique has been used for years by editors of fashion magazines. The method is simple: look at your images in a grid and see which ones catch your eye when placed next to the other images. If it draws your attention, it is likely to draw the attention of a judge, too!</p>
<p><strong><em>Want a great place to share those WOW pictures?! Share them in the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/14-challenges-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monthly Clickin Moms forum photo contest</a>! With a new theme each month, amazing prizes, fellow photographers there to encourage you, and a chance to be featured here on the Clickin Moms Blog, it&#8217;s a win!</em></strong></p>

			<h1>4. Define Strong Elements of the Frame</h1>
<p>When you have selected an image that draws your eye, take the time to define <em>why</em> it stands out in a crowd. Is there a defining moment? Is there a strong emotion that pulls at your heart? Is the light simply amazing? Dos the composition draw you into the frame? Is there a clear story that connects the viewer to the scene?</p>

			<p>Once you know what makes your image strong, be sure that it still falls in line with the character of the competition. Do the outstanding elements of your image fall in line with the outstanding elements of past winners of this particular contest? You don&#8217;t necessarily have to fall in line with the previous winners, but it is always good to use them as a baseline.</p>

			<h1>5. Originality</h1>
<p>Being true to yourself is always going to be the best thing you can do for success in competitions. Is your image fresh and new? Is it true to your creative voice? Are you offering a unique perspective that is true to you and drawing the viewer into your world?</p>
<p>It can be a challenge to answer these questions! You are YOU and so identifying your work as different can be difficult! The more you practice identifying your own unique style in your work, the easier this becomes. The more you listen to your heart behind the camera, the more likely your images will be true to you and will catch the attention of competition judges.</p>

			<h1>6. Keep a clean frame</h1>
<p>Check your frame and background: are there any distracting elements that might pull the judges&#8217; eyes away from the amazing parts of your photograph? If so, can you remove these elements? Or should you choose a different photograph?</p>
<p>I recently received an award for an image with bride standing in the door frame. It was such a simple image and when I received news about this award I looked at the image again to see why it might have been chosen for an award. I think that the simplicity is what made it so strong. I had taken the time to clone out all of the little distractions around the bride and it resulted in an image that was focused on just her and the light and the overall effect was that much more powerful. Be sure to take your time, look at your last edit again, and make sure everything is just the way you want it!</p>

			<h1>7. Give yourself a break</h1>
<p>Have you ever stared at the computer screen for so long only to come back and realize that you missed BIG things in your editing? Sometimes you simply need to give yourself a little break (or two or three) and come to re-edit a few times before you feel happy with final results. Take a break if you feel overwhelmed by something and then come back to the image later with a fresh head.</p>
<p>I had a case when I been struggling with one particular edit. The color was killing me! I did at least ten different edits and simply could not get it to look the way I wanted it to. I finally walked away from the computer, gave myself (and my eyes!) a rest, and came back to edit the photo and win an award with it!</p>

			<h1>8. Print your images</h1>
<p>Some competitions require you to provide printed photographs to enter. However, even if it isn&#8217;t required I always recommend printing your work. This allows you to see how the image looks and feels on paper which is decidedly different than on a screen. Computer monitors vary but a professional lab will be sure to calibrate their printers to ensure that the photos are consistent and true.</p>
<p>One time, I printed a set of images and one of them was simply not looking the way I wanted, so I replaced it with another image that printed more consistently with the rest of the set. I am convinced that this last-minute change was what helped me win that competition! There also was another time when the judges discussed my entry and commented that while they loved the digital image, the printed version did not speak to them in the same way. Be sure you have seen your images in print before submitting them!</p>

<p>Having an extra set of eyes on your work, while it can be nerve-wracking, is never a bad idea. Choose a trusted person or community. A Facebook group of photographer friends, the critique forum on Clickin Moms, or a respected mentor can give you invaluable advice if you are having trouble choosing an image for a competition.</p>

			<h1>10. Trust your heart</h1>
<p>Asking for the advice of others can be helpful, but if I disagree I always go with my own heart. I once asked my dear husband to help me choose images for a competition and he rejected a picture that I simply loved. I went with my heart and submitted the photo anyway and guess what? I won an award!</p>
<p>Winning an award is not a final destination. It can bring you some personal satisfaction and exposure which is great for marketing, but it should never stop you from future efforts. Don&#8217;t allow a rejection to defeat you or a win to allow you to rest on your laurels. Rather, take participation in competitions as an opportunity to evaluate your work, grow, and progress toward the artist that you are meant to be.</p>

			<p>We all love stories.</p>
<p>We love to read them and we get excited watching them.</p>
<p>But sometimes we forget to use storytelling in our photography when documenting our everyday family moments.</p>
<p>How do we tell a story in a picture? What main elements do we need to keep in mind while capturing and telling our story? Here&#8217;s a start.</p>
<h2>1. Keep your camera ready.</h2>
<p>Keep an eye out for key moments as you never know what opportunity might come along. Storing your camera in a central location like the living room or the kitchen island makes it easier to grab at a moments notice. If you&#8217;re out and about, having it wrapped around your neck, ready to go.</p>

<p>Show us who they are and what they do using clues. There&#8217;s always a main subject in a story &#8211; showcase them using environmental shots and supporting objects.</p>
<p>For example, our clues on the beach are sand, waves, seaside line, rocks, wind in the hair, birds, safeguard&#8217;s building, umbrellas in the sand, etc. Tell us their story, what they do and what they see.</p>

<p>Observation, as well as intuition, can help you feel when a moment is about to happen. Be prepared to capture the critical moment your instinct is telling you is coming. For example&#8230;</p>
<p>As soon as a one-year-old tastes the cake for the first time, their next action is to dive their face right into it.</p>
<p>When an officiant announces Mr. and Mrs. for the first time, just moments after their first kiss as husband and wife, be ready for the huge smiles and fist pumps.</p>
<p>The moment your toddler wiggles free from the towel after an evening bath, you know they&#8217;ll giddily go streaking through the house.</p>
<p>Shoot less when you sense these moments! Instead of rapidly depressing the shutter button, slow down and focus on the best composition and wait for the moment to come to you. It allows you find one showcasing strong image when everything lines up perfectly, making a significant difference in impact to the viewer.</p>

			<h2>4. Capture the in-between moments.</h2>
<p>Shoot the story transitions like when a subject walks or runs from one location to another, moving from one part of the story to another. These details allow the viewer to FEEL the moment, imagining the action and visualizing a full story based on the split-second moment.</p>
<p>I love to capture the details of movement following my subjects from one location to another.</p>

			<h2>5. Remember your story line.</h2>
<p>Have a definite beginning, middle and end of your story similar to a movie screenplay or a novel.</p>
<p>You can tell your story in many photographs starting with an environmental wide angle shot to set the location of the story. Then capture the details like toys laying in the sand, movement in the grass, people walking towards their destination, etc.</p>
<p>Further on, you can photograph actions as well as quiet moments, keeping in mind the mood and emotion that you&#8217;d like to relay.</p>
<p>The end of the story will differ depending on your ending. Some endings may include a sunset photo on the beach, flowers on the side of the road, sleeping kids in the car exhausted after a big trip. How you end will depends on the feel of your story.</p>

			<p>Does it feel like you’ve already used every single point in your house: bedrooms, living area, kitchen, bathroom and even hallway?</p>
<p>Are you tired of trying to create something new and different?</p>
<p>One of my personal favorite spots may be one you haven&#8217;t thought of to use yet &#8211; the front door!</p>
<p>This spot sees so many family moments: rushing off to school, everyone piling inside, loads of shoes and dirty gumboots, little hands playing with toys next to the door frame and more! So many stories happened around and behind the front door.</p>
<p>From everyday moments to paid photo sessions, you can utilize the front door for any purpose. Here&#8217;s a few ways to do so!</p>
<h2>Utilizing the front door for its light.</h2>
<h3>Flat light</h3>
<p>The light coming from outside is perfect for capturing portraits/headshots, everyday moments with kids playing, taking off outerwear and just having fun. When facing your subject directly towards the opening of the front door, you&#8217;ll get a flat lit image.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Flat light works beautifully to hide imperfections in the skin since there are very little, if any, shadows. For example, this could be ideal for a teen who is self-conscious about acne.</p>

			<h3>Pocket of light</h3>
<p>You can use the light coming from the front door to create moody and dramatic photos. You can also catch slivers of light coming from just a little bit of an open door and falling on your subject.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Expose for the highlights which will allow all the clutter and distractive elements to disappear into the dark shadows. After all, we all know how messy a house with little ones can be!</p>

			<h3>Side light</h3>
<p>You can capture emotional portraits or lifestyle moments using the side light coming from the front door. It will give you a perfect dramatic effect with light coming to one side of the face and shadows on the other.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> This is a great opportunity to play with Rembrandt lighting by choosing the right angle.</p>

			<h3>Backlight</h3>
<p>You can change the angle and perspective and capture the moments using backlight coming from the front door. Just make sure to choose the correct exposure to avoid too much light coming through the lens and creating distractive flare.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your subject&#8217;s face is too hazy from the backlight, either slightly adjust your angle to minimize the haze or use a reflector to bounce some light back on them.</p>

			<h3>Flat lay photos</h3>
<p>You can use a front door light to capture the details: toys on the floor, kids foot/hands, and even use it for your business commercial work as product placement, photos with your branding, packaging and anything you like.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> I recommend watching how light changes during the day: the direction, softness, and temperature. These skills of observing light can help you discover the right way of using it in your photography.</p>

<h3>Framing</h3>
<p>The front door is a perfect framing element. You can have the door open or closed based on your preferences and decisive moment.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to place your subject in the middle of the door frame or wait for the moment when your subject moves there on her own without any lines coming through her body.</p>

			<h3>Leading lines</h3>
<p>Leading lines can be common around the front door. Don&#8217;t forget to use them to help direct the viewer to your subject. Leading lines could include step railing, a row of flowers or shrubbery, a console table, the back of the couch, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When your leading lines are symmetrical in the frame, a center composition often works quite well.</p>

			<h3>Texture</h3>
<p>Each entry has a different texture: wood, glass, metal, etc. Capture that texture in your photos. My front door has an old wooden texture which feels cozy and homey with warm natural feeling in images.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t stop there. You can even capture the texture in the floor or details.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Textures are more noticeable in the shadows so make sure your door falls into the shadows or you underexpose your image some.</p>

			<h3>Color</h3>
<p>Color is another element of design that can be perfectly used for capturing images at the front door. If you&#8217;ve traveled around Europe, especially Italy, you may remember the fantastic entries. All the different colors with old style handles taking instant attention &#8211; it&#8217;s like an entrance to another world and beautiful in photos.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the color wheel to guide you on how to dress your subject depending on the color of the door. Colors opposite one another compliment each other well and will help your subject to stand out against the door color.</p>
