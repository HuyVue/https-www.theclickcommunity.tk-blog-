			<p>It’s no secret: my family LOVES Halloween. I mean, what isn’t there to love? You get to pretend you are someone else. You get to stay up past bedtime running around the neighborhood with friends. And there are mass quantities of candy.</p>
<p>And because we love it so much, I have taken extra care to document our Halloween costumes over the years. While of course you could just snap a quick phone picture and go about your trick-or-treating mission, I think it’s a lot more fun to take Halloween portraits that transform us into the characters we are that year.</p>

			<h2>Get your shot well before Halloween</h2>
<p>I learned this lesson the hard way. If you wait until October 31 to take your portraits, you are going to be the villain that kept your kids from trick-or-treating while you played with your camera settings and backdrops and lights.</p>
<p>No one wants to delay CANDY on Halloween!</p>
<p>That’s why I usually start planning Halloween costumes far in advance of the actual day. Everything is ready to go in September and then I can take portraits weeks ahead of Halloween and post them on social media on the 31st.</p>
<p>This means that I have several weeks to take the kids’ portraits. No rushing, no stressing, and I get to be the fun mom who let’s them wear a costume on a day that isn’t Halloween!</p>

			<h2>Consider a theme</h2>
<p>We are a family of 7 which means that there is never going to be a year where all of us want to be the same thing for Halloween. One year the five-year-old is going to want to be a Transformer and the ten-year-old is going to want to be a wolf and I am going to want to be Bride of Frankenstein.</p>
<p>However, if I come-up with a theme and let everyone choose a costume that fits within it, our portraits are more cohesive. I have a set of images that go together and each member of the family still gets to choose what they want to be within that theme.</p>
<p>The key here is to keep it relatively vague. Over the years we have been “Villains and Heroes,” “Storybook Characters,” and “Monsters.” These allow the kids to have some fun choosing who they will be, putting their own stamp on the final costume while still being tied to the rest of the family.</p>

			<h2>Make the costume good</h2>
<p>I am not saying that you need to bring out your sewing machine and labor over detailed patterns. But I promise that you are going to be disappointed if you have an ill-fitting costume with the velcro closures showing in your portraits.</p>
<p>So when you go to dress-up for Halloween, find costumes that are good. Make sure they fit, add some more expensive elements to cheap costumes, and hide unsightly, inauthentic components with strategic posing or other costume elements.</p>
<p>For my Wonder Woman above, many of the accessories were metallic fabric instead of the gold that Wonder Woman herself would wear. Swapping these out for hard metallic plastic pieces made a huge difference in the believability of the final portrait.</p>

			<h2>Practice your make-up skills</h2>
<p>Having great make-up can make all the difference in transforming from the everyday version of yourself to an entirely new character. Anything from a simple contour to a full face of latex can be necessary to brush-up on your brush skills.</p>
<p>I scoured the internet for tutorials on how to transform myself into Cruella Devil. Who knew that covering up your eyebrows was so difficult?! That said, having those high-arching black brows and that cartoonishly pointed nose (all make-up!) made all the difference in changing me from Kellie to Cruella.</p>
<p>If I have learned anything from doing Halloween make-up all these years, it’s that too much probably isn’t enough. This isn’t what you wear for your daily routine or even an event or fancy date night. This is a mask of make-up. You aren’t going to want to go to the grocery store like this but it’s going to look great in the picture…I promise!</p>

			<h2>Set the mood</h2>
<p>Anyone can wear a great costume, do great make-up, and take a quick snap shot. But the real fun lies in creating a mood around the costume that helps set the tone of the character you want to be.</p>
<p>Canned atmosphere, a fog machine, or some fog overlays can make a scene look spooky and mysterious. When you want to be a monster or a villain, this can make a huge difference in the impression your costume leaves on the viewer!</p>
<p>My favorite way to set the mood is to use light with intention. In fact, I do this even when I am not photographing Halloween costumes!</p>
<p>Think about how different kinds of light might make a character appear. Back light is dreamy and hazy. Split light is a bit more mysterious. Hard light is harsh and striking while soft light is more forgiving.</p>
<p>When I was photographing my Frankenstein’s monster (Mr. Bieser is such a trooper!) I lit him from below to mimic the light of spooky story time at elementary school sleepovers. This also created a large shadow behind him that exaggerated his size and added to his terrifying costume.</p>

			<h2>Have fun editing</h2>
<p>Halloween portraits are the perfect time to let loose a little bit with your post processing. You don’t have to create realistic scenes here. In fact, the point is to emphasize fantasy!</p>
<p>This means that you can have a lot of fun to help turn your subject into their character. Change colors, add weather, transform their shape…there is no limit to what you can do here!</p>
<p>When I was photographing my little Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, I just loved her pigtail braids and her skipping along the path and her blue gingham dress. She was embodying Dorothy perfectly!</p>
<p>And yet, I couldn’t help but think that the scene needed just a little more magic. So, I started to play in Photoshop. A little rainbow overlay added the perfect bit of wonder to the scene and while not realistic, changes this shot from “Annie in a Dorothy costume” to “Dorothy is here!”</p>

			<h2>Don’t take any of this too seriously</h2>
<p>Obviously I am a huge fan of Halloween, but I urge you to keep the spirit of the day in mind as you photograph your family costumes. This is supposed to be fun. You aren’t supposed to turn into an actual monster as you go about documenting your costumes.</p>
<p>Instead, look at this as an opportunity to be creative and try new things. It’s a chance to get the whole family involved in the picture-making process.</p>
<p>So let loose, have a blast, and laugh a lot as you transform into your characters. Taking photos is all about capturing memories and I want these to be some of your best.</p>
<p><em>We love hearing about the creative ways you celebrate! Share your Halloween costume ideas in the comments below!</em></p>

			<p>There are lots of sweet milestones in a child’s lifetime. First steps. First words. The first day of school.</p>
<p>And in the our household, one of the big milestones is our kids’ first time up to bat. We are a baseball family through and through and when one of our kids gets to put on little cleats and have a helmet wobbling on their heads as they trot up to the tee, it’s a major event.</p>
<p>Sports are a big part of so many kids’ memories. The competition and camaraderie are transformative and can help shape the kinds of people they become.</p>
<p>As a mother, I find documenting my kids’ experiences in sports to be incredibly rewarding. Not only am I capturing them in their element doing activities they enjoy, but I am also capturing the process of them learning lifelong lessons. And it doesn’t hurt that they are usually way more excited about me taking these photos than they are about more formal portraits!</p>
<p>All that said, there are a lot of things to consider when photographing kids playing sports. Over the years I have learned some good lessons and today, I am here to share all of them with you.</p>

			<h2>Bring the right lens</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of making the gear I have on me work. It’s the photographer who takes the picture, not the camera, right?!</p>
<p>But in a special situation like a sporting event, having the right camera and lenses can make all the difference in getting *the* shot or missing it altogether.</p>
<p>You are likely going to want to use a telephoto lens (unless your kid doesn’t mind you laying in the middle of the field during the game…and I promise you that she minds!). A <a href="https://amzn.to/2NSlxeF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70-200mm</a> is a great versatile focal length that will serve you well on and off the field. You will likely still have to crop in from time to time as those fields get bigger as the kids get older but it’s a great place to start.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on all the action, consider renting a super telephoto lens (I love the <a href="https://amzn.to/2A52e9V" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">200-500mm zoom</a>) for a special game and feel like you are a Sports Illustrated photographer for the day.</p>
<p>The key is to have something that allows you to zoom in beyond what your naked eye sees. This will keep you out of the way but make it feel like you were right there.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right settings</h2>
<p>In most cases, your kids are going to be moving quite a bit when they are playing a sport. This means that in order to freeze the action you are going to want to have a fast shutter speed. This means that every time you hit the shutter button, the shutter is opening and closing super fast to ensure that only one part of your athlete’s movement is captured in the photograph.</p>
<p>For game time, I like to keep my shutter speed as fast as possible. My camera goes up to 1/8000 second and if I can stay there, I will! If the light situation makes that impossible, I will adjust my ISO and aperture settings so that I can stay above 1/1250 at the very least. This ensures that I don’t have any motion blur in my photos and I get that frozen action that looks so great in sports photography.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is your white balance. While it’s not as much of a concern on the baseball field where we are outside, indoor sports like basketball and volleyball have much trickier light situations where correct white balance can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Be sure to dial in your settings to correct for any strange color casts that might be coming from fluorescent lights. You might have some color casts to edit out from green grass or yellow wood flooring, so keep an eye on those things when you have your photos in your post processing program of choice.</p>

			<h2>Get the in between moments</h2>
<p>While the action shots are definitely awesome, I find that the photos that most often pull at my heart are the ones of the in between moments. My camera is always seeking a furrowed brow watching the action, a big gulp of water, or a simple moment taking a break from the work of running up and down the field.</p>

			<p>When photographing your kids’ playing sport, don’t forget to seek out the quieter moments. These can be filled with so much emotion and are a great way to tell the story of the whole game.</p>
<p>Scan the sidelines, be watchful during timeouts, and keep your camera ready when they’re sitting the bench. The in between moments are just as important as any touchdown or home run.</p>
<h2>Capture the details</h2>
<p>From our place on the sidelines, we see the whole game. It’s a wide angle view of the venue and allows us to appreciate all of the action happening on the court/field/arena/stadium/gym.</p>
<p>But when you are playing the game? Everything is right up close. A pitcher can feel every individual lace on the baseball. A golfer can see every dimple on the golf ball. Basketball players feel the net brush by their fingertips.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that when we are wanting to tell the story of a sport, we would want to capture the details as well as the big picture. Consider zeroing in on a foot kicking a ball or hands holding a bat. Removing everything else from the frame is a great way to draw attention to the little things that make the athletic experience so unique.</p>

			<p>I dusted off my macro converters to capture this up-close shot of my son holding a game ball. I love how you can see the individual threads in the laces and the dust from the field. And he likes the photo so much that he asked for a print for his bedroom!</p>
<h2>Include the team</h2>
<p>While I am most definitely at any game with my camera to capture my kids, it would be tragic not to get shots of the whole team. The friendships formed through playing together are a huge part of what makes sports in childhood so special.</p>

			<p>As a kids and family photographer, I am not working with picture perfect models. I am photographing <em>real</em> people. People who blink from time to time. Who yawn in the middle of a shot. People who are just like me and my family.</p>
<p>And the more people I add to the frame? The more chances there are for at least one of them to be blinking/yawning/wiggling in any given photograph. If I had to scrap every photo where someone wasn&#8217;t perfect, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to deliver many to my clients!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why mastering the Photoshop head swap has been so important. This allows me to take those photos where almost everyone looks perfect and make the changes to let everyone look their best.</p>
<p>The best part is that head swaps don&#8217;t have to be difficult. With the right preparation, you can make head swaps that look convincing and don&#8217;t make you want to scream. Follow the steps below and you&#8217;ll be well on your way to making everyone look great!</p>

			<h2>Start with the right photos</h2>
<p>If you try to do a head swap with two photos from two different sessions, you are likely going to run into some issues. The white balance, the direction of the light, and the surroundings are all going to be different in those two photos. This makes it nearly impossible to put them together convincingly.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will want to start with two photos taken relatively close together. This will ensure that you have an easier time blending them together as the direction of the light and elements in the background will be mostly the same.</p>

			<h2>Do global edits before you start swapping</h2>
<p>I make big global edits to white balance, clarity, and exposure in Adobe Camera Raw. When I am planning to do a head swap, I will bring both photos into ACR simultaneously so that I can ensure that these global edits are identical.</p>
<p>This ensures that when I do the head swap the clarity, exposure, and skin tones match. If you have a slightly cooler white balance in one photo and put a warmer toned face in that picture, it will be an instant giveaway that some Photoshop shenanigans were happening&#8230;and we don&#8217;t want that!</p>

			<h2>Select the face you want to swap&#8230;and a lot more</h2>
<p>The biggest surprise for me when learning to do convincing head swaps was how little I would be working on the actual face. Instead, It&#8217;s much more about blending in the surrounding area. The goal is to incorporate the face seamlessly into the rest of the photo.</p>
<p>This means that when you are selecting the area of the &#8220;good face&#8221; that you want to copy onto the photo where everyone else looks good, you will need to select a much larger area than you might think you have to. The more surrounding area you give yourself to work with, the easier it will be to blend it in.</p>
<p>You can use the lasso tool or the rectangular marquis tool in Photoshop to select the area you want to copy. Once you have it selected, go to Edit &gt; Copy and then head over to the final photo to paste it.</p>

			<h2>Layer masks are your friend</h2>
<p>Layer masks are a large reason that I love Photoshop. They give me full control over how much and where  any of my adjustments affect my final image. And layer masks are key to performing a convincing head swap.</p>
<p>Once you have copied and pasted your selection onto the final photo, you will see that you have created a new layer. Move that layer to the general location where you will want the new face to land. I reduce the opacity of the layer here to about 50%. This way I can see through it and place the new face directly on top of the original.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Here you will add a layer mask to your copied layer. You will see that the mask is completely white. This means that you can see all of what is on the layer. When the layer mask is black, you are hiding the layer.</p>
<p>To blend our new face onto the original photo, we are going to paint black onto that white layer mask. This means that we are going to hide the areas we copied that we don&#8217;t want to be in the final photo and we are going to leave the areas we want to have changed.</p>

			<h2>Work with the right brushes</h2>
<p>As you paint black onto your layer mask, you will want to have the right tool. I use the paintbrush tool at 100% opacity and 0% hardness (to start). This means that you will have a super soft edge to the brush (great for blending things together). You will be painting pure black as you start to hide the areas of the layer you do not want to see.</p>
<p>Start by removing any harsh edges from your layer. Then work your way inward to blend the background. You will want to pay careful attention to patterns and textures as these can be tricky to blend.</p>
<p>As you start to work along edges, you might need to change the hardness of your brush. Having a slightly harder brush will allow you to paint an edge so that you get it to look natural in the new background you are adding for the head swap.</p>

			<h2>Be a little bossy</h2>
<p>The kids I photograph are not professional models. They are kids. And when I aim my big camera at them, they often don’t really know what to do.</p>
<p>A big way to help them get comfortable while also helping you get the photos you want is to tell them exactly what to do. Show them the precise spot where they should stand. Tell them to put one hand in a pocket or a hand on a hip. Have them look here, then look there, then smile, then no smile.</p>
<p>While you may feel like you are just rattling off orders, you are actually creating an environment where your kid subjects can feel confident. By giving a direction and then letting them succeed, you are showing them that they can succeed in this photo mission.</p>
<p>Even more, being a little bossy creates some boundaries that will keep your subjects engaged and (somewhat) behaved as you shoot. I love a little innocent rebelliousness in the form of giggles and tickles, but I don’t want there to be chaos in front of the camera. Being direct in what I need the kids to do makes me a (friendly) authoritative figure. It gives me the chance to control what is happening so that I can get the results that I want.</p>

			<h2>Choose your camera settings wisely</h2>
<p>There are some technical considerations to make when photographing any large group. The biggest challenge with groups of kids is ensuring that they are all in focus.</p>
<p>You will want to close down your aperture (have a larger f-stop number than you might usually have). This will give you a larger depth of field so that more people in the group will be in focus even if they are not in a perfect line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/aperture-science-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is aperture? A beginner’s guide for photographers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>You will also want to have a fast shutter speed. Even when kids are sitting still, they are wiggling. I never let my shutter speed go below 1/125 second and that’s when I have a super cooperative subject. If you are anticipating any movement that is more dynamic, you will want to make that shutter speed faster. I like to stay at 1/800 for walking, and even faster if I am wanting to capture jumping, running, skipping, or twirling.</p>
<p>As such, I am always willing to sacrifice ISO or add some extra light to accommodate these settings. Proper exposure and focus are possible with a group of kids, but you have to plan for it!</p>

			<h2>Be playful</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, there was nothing worse than being prepped for a boring activity where I had to behave myself. Sitting for forever while the adults drone on about adult things and having to just sit still and follow orders is the worst!</p>
<p>So if you want a group of kids to be on board for a photo session, you aren’t going to want to make it a chore. Instead, make it a game!</p>
<p>If you want everyone to be sitting still, have a contest to see who can keep their feet glued to the spot longest. If you are like me and love a lot of movement in your shot, have a race or see who can jump the highest. Even a simple prompt like, “Everyone look at the kid who is most likely to toot at the dinner table!” can turn boring picture day into a fun/funny event.</p>
<p>Having a playful personality yourself and making it so that the kids can be in their natural state of play. And when your subjects are in their natural state, you are going to have happy, relaxed subjects who will give you the shots you want.</p>

			<h2>Know the dynamics</h2>
<p>Every group has its own interpersonal dynamics. You will want to take the time to ask about and observe the dynamics in the group of kids you are photographing. This ensures that you are working with your subjects rather than against them.</p>
<p>In my own family, I know that if I put the nine-year-old next to the twelve-year-old, I am asking for trouble. However, if I put the fifteen-year-old next to the four-year-old I have a match made in heaven. When I am placing all my kids in their spots for a photo, I know that if I don’t keep these dynamics in mind that I will have a much harder time getting everyone to cooperate for the shot.</p>
<p>When photographing kids with whom you are not as familiar, you will want to be sure that you are watching for cues to see who gets along and who doesn’t as much. Ask mom and dad who plays together the most. Observe who naturally gravitates toward each other as you work through a session. Be on the lookout for any bickering, pestering, or side eyeing.</p>
<p>And as much as this is for you to be able to navigate setting up the photo with ease, this is also about capturing the kids as they really are. If there are certain kids within the group who are more likely to be together than others, it makes sense to show that in your photos! Embrace this as an opportunity to illustrate the kids as they are rather than as a hurtle to overcome.</p>

			<h2>Get comfortable with the head swap</h2>
<p>With any group of people, you are going to have that one perfect shot. Everyone is smiling and happy. The posing is perfect. The light is gorgeous.</p>
<p>And then there is that one guy who has his eyes closed!</p>
<p>This is just the nature of adding more variables to the situation. The more people you add, the less likely it is that you will get everyone picture-perfect in the same shot.<br />
Luckily, we photographers have a little magic on our side called Photoshop. While editing can seem overwhelming and scary at times, there are some tricks that are absolute lifesavers when photographing groups of kids. The head swap is for sure one of these tricks.</p>
<p>This just means that you take a face from one photo in a similar setting and light situation and place it onto another photo where the other people in the frame look their best. The trick is to blend it into the photo (using layer masks and super soft brushes) so that no one can tell that it wasn’t perfect from the start. Like a lot of things in photography, it takes practice…but it’s a skill worth practicing!</p>

			<h2>Embrace imperfection</h2>
<p>With social media showing us “perfect” images all the time, it’s easy to think that our less-than-perfect photos aren’t worthy. And chances are, when you have a group of kids in the frame, “perfection” is going to be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>But the truth is, perfection is a myth. And if you ask me, one of the things that makes kids great is their carefree nature. They don’t feel the pressure to be perfect. They just are. That in and of itself is pretty perfect.</p>
<p>So when photographing a group of kids, let go of the idea of perfection and allow your subjects to be who they are. Don’t judge the final shots by how perfect everyone looks and instead seek out the moments and expressions that speak to the moment. These are the photos that really matter and when you embrace them, you will find yourself so much more motivated to reach for your camera.</p>

<p>And of course, you are going to want to have your camera ready!</p>
<p>But how do you tell the story of a new school year in pictures? How do you speak to the events of the back-to-school routine and make these photos stand out from the everyday?</p>

			<h2>Backpacks</h2>
<p>I remember it like it was yesterday. The day I got my first backpack for my first day of Kindergarten.</p>
<p>It had Rainbow Brite on it and as soon as I brought it home I filled it with my favorite stuffed animals and a bag of cookies (because what else could I possibly need at school?!). I felt like such a big kid as I skipped around the house with it on my back.</p>
<p>And I absolutely love watching my own kids with their carefully selected backpacks each new school year. They speak to their ages, stages, and personalities. Having that new backpack signals the beginning of a new year of learning and adventure. We take a photo of each kid with his/her backpack every year and it’s one of my favorite photo traditions.</p>

			<h2>Supplies</h2>
<p>Notebooks and pencils and glue sticks and erasers might not seem like photo-worthy subjects on the surface. However, school supplies are such a part of a new school year and these items open the door for some creative photo opportunities.</p>
<p>Try taking your camera to the store and photographing your kids choosing their supplies from their list. Or maybe get a shot of your child writing his/her name on the front of a notebook (because there is <i>nothing</i> cuter than little kid writing!). Or you could even create a flat lay or still life scene with all of the supplies! Test your creativity and see how you can be inspired by seemingly mundane objects.</p>

			<h2>Apples</h2>
<p>I am pretty sure no one gives an apple to the teacher anymore, but apples are still seen as a symbol for school. They are produce of the season and are a great way to add a little extra sign of the start of school.</p>
<p>You could set-up an adorable lifestyle portrait of your child at a desk with an apple on it. You could have your child actually take an apple to his/her teacher and document the event. Or you could play with the alphabet and make an “A is for apple” still life.</p>
<p>It’s a simple, inexpensive item that can add just the right touch of back-to-school to make your photos special.</p>

			<h2>The school building</h2>
<p>The school building itself is a great prop to signal the start of the school year! Whether it’s a new building for your child this year or the same one he/she has attended for years, incorporating it into your photos is a great way to highlight the event of back-to-school.</p>
<p>To create an amazing series over the course of your child’s school career, try picking a place (like the front doors of the school) and taking a photo there every year. It is a memorable way to document his/her growth and include the place where so much of that growth happens.</p>
<p>Also try to photograph the entire building and a sign with the name of the school on it. I know that my elementary school is no longer standing and to have a photo to show my own kids would be so special! These contextual photos can add to the back-to-school story and make it that much richer.</p>

			<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>No one says that you have to be subtle when documenting the first day of school. You can spell out all the details of your child’s first day with a cute sign!</p>
<p>I really love my letterboards because I can use the same one for all five of my kids. But the options for cute back-to-school signs are really endless! You could use a chalkboard, a canvas, or even a piece of paper in a simple frame.</p>
<p>Include the information that is important in marking the occasion: your child’s name, the year, your child’s grade, the teacher’s name, and anything else that you deem important as he/she embarks upon a new year at school.</p>

			<p>I love kids&#8217; handwriting and I think it is such a sweet way to show an age and stage (give me all the backwards S&#8217;s!). That&#8217;s why I love the idea of using a kid&#8217;s easy for back-to-school photos. Have your student write her name, age, grade, teacher, the year, and anything else that helps you remember the occasion.</p>

			<p>No matter how you choose to document the back-to-school season, the most important thing is that you have your camera out. Whether your child is heading to her first day of preschool or he is going to be a senior in high school, these are days you will want to remember. The details will fade from your memories too fast.</p>
<p>So work with intention in telling the story of back-to-school and include items that make that story richer. I can’t wait to see how you use these items and if you have more great back-to-school prop suggestions, be sure to share them below!</p>

			<h2>Be inspired by this year’s list</h2>
<p>Even with the best of intentions, it can be hard to feel inspired to pick-up your camera in the summer months. With the kids out of school and the endless requests for juice boxes and screen time that come with that, we can feel a little drained at the end of the day!</p>
<p>And yet, we would argue that some of the <i>best </i>memories happen in summer. Which means that this is the time of year that you want to be most intentional in capturing the places and things that make summer so special for your family.</p>
<p>That’s where the Photo Hunt list is your best friend. We’ve worked to put together 87 items that scream summertime, taking the guesswork out of what you should be capturing. From bare feet to cookouts to wildflowers, there is no shortage of inspiration here to help you capture the magic of summer.</p>
<p>We like keeping the list on our phones as that allows us to have it on hand at all times. You can also keep a printed copy up on the refrigerator or family bulletin board and check off items as you find them (because there’s nothing quite as satisfying as crossing things off a list, right?!).</p>

			<h2>Take your camera everywhere</h2>
<p>Whether it’s a fancy DSLR or your phone camera, keep a camera close at hand wherever you go. Summer memories happen everywhere and we want you to be ready to capture them!</p>
<p>I keep my camera with a versatile lens on my kitchen counter. This is the hub of the house and by having my camera here, it is easy to grab it when the kids are doing something cute in the living room, the backyard, or anywhere else!</p>
<p>If you feel nervous about having your professional equipment out in public, your phone is perfectly capable of taking amazing photographs! Pay close attention to composition, color, and light to make the most of the scene in front of you.</p>

			<h2>Make it a game for everyone</h2>
<p>The Photo Hunt is the best not just in how it allows you to connect with your fellow Click Community photographers, but also in how it allows you to get your kids in on the game! Give everyone in your family a list and work together to find all of the items. You will be <i>amazed</i> at how much more willing they are to be in the frame when they are invested in the process like this!</p>
<p>Have older kids? Let them take their own photos from the list! A little family competition to see who can find all 87 items is a great idea and you can offer the prize of an ice cream cone for the winner (and then photograph them eating it because that’s on this year’s list!).</p>

			<h2>Don’t be a “pro” for every shot</h2>
<p>While we know you like to get every shot just right, you don’t need to be perfect for the Photo Hunt. Instead, <i>have fun.</i> You can get super creative and artistically involved for some of the items on the list, but don’t hesitate to get a snapshot every once in a while.</p>
<p>Another of the joys of the Photo Hunt is that is allows us to relax a bit (because that’s what summer is all about!). We get to let loose and embrace imperfection. We get to shoot for the sake of checking something off the list, not to submit a new portfolio. That kind of freedom can feel awesome!</p>
<p>So instead of aiming to create art with all 87 items, choose those that speak to you most and try to capture those in your own special style. The rest of them? You can surely get artsy with those too, but focus more on capturing them as part of your summer. Rather than putting pressure on yourself to be perfect, enjoy checking things off the list and shooting with less expectation.</p>

			<h2>Try something new</h2>
<p>Is there something on the list that isn’t a part of your summer routine? Maybe give it a try! You might find that you are inspired to create a new summertime tradition because of the Photo Hunt list.</p>
<p>In the same way, try photographing things that are outside of your normal repertoire. Are you a kids and family photographer? This list has plenty of opportunities to incorporate that. But we also think you should try food photography, landscape photography, and maybe even some macro!</p>
<p>The Photo Hunt is a great time to experiment and the perfect opportunity to discover new things that you love.</p>

			<h2>Think outside the box</h2>
<p>The Photo Hunt list doesn’t have to be taken literally. We want you to get creative with how you interpret the items and how you capture them in your photos.</p>
<p>Don’t have a plan to go to the beach? Maybe you can set-up a Barbie beach party in the sandbox in the backyard! Don’t want to come home with a new pet frog? Try photographing a frog umbrella or make frog origami. Bring your farmers market haul home and take a fine art shot of your veggies. The sky is the limit here!</p>
<p>The possibilities are truly endless and this is your chance to get creative have some fun.</p>

			<h2>Share your photos</h2>
<p>We have found that sharing your summer photos (and using the hashtag #ClickCommunity21) is a big part of what makes the Photo Hunt so special.</p>
<p>When you share your photos, you get the opportunity to share your unique summer experience with the world. We love looking through the hashtagged photos throughout July and seeing the variety of ways in which you interpret the items on the list.</p>
<p>Even more, sharing your photos will keep you motivated to keep shooting all summer long. When people get used to seeing the summer fun you are capturing, they aren’t going to want it to stop! Sharing keeps you accountable and that’s a good thing.</p>

			<h2>Have a plan for your pictures</h2>
<p>While we definitely want to see all of your photos on Instagram and on the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/topic/437048-summer-photo-hunt-image-share-post-your-photos-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click Community forum</a>, we also don’t want your summer memories trapped on your hard drive! We think you should have a plan to print your photos!</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a photo book that you can keep on the coffee table. Perhaps you will pick a few favorites and have them printed and framed for the wall. Or maybe you will have your photos made into a puzzle or into greeting cards or put on a mug.</p>
<p>However you choose to display your photos, we are all for it. This is the best way to relive the magic of summer all year long and your photos deserve to be cherished.</p>
<p>So get out there into the sunshine. Take your camera. And capture all of the fun that summer has to offer. We can’t wait to see what you create.</p>

<p>I am also a mother who loves to take pictures of her family. And while I am not necessarily ashamed of our “lived-in” home, I am also not always wanting to advertise the piles of school papers, stacks of laundry, muddy footprints, and scattered toys that are part of our everyday.</p>
<p>More than misrepresenting our mess, I want to make sure that what is important to me is readily visible to my audience in my photos. I don’t want our mess distracting from my kids’ adorable little faces!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>Change your perspective</h2>
<p>Changing your perspective is a great way to add variety to your photographs. Instead of having everything shot from where you stand, try getting down low to make your subject look larger than life or shooting from above for a more authoritative point of view.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>But even more than adding personality and variety to your photos, you can use different perspectives to remove distractions! Shooting from down low eliminates any clutter on the floor and can give you a clean background with the sky or ceiling.</p>

			<p>When you shoot from above, clutter on the walls or elsewhere in any given environment disappears. Instead, your elevated perspective allows just one small area of the floor or ground to be the background.</p>
<p>So, when you look at a scene that might feel distracting and overwhelming, try to look at it from a new perspective. Find an area without clutter. Use that to draw the attention of your audience toward your subject and away from the mess.</p>

			<h2>Use light with intention</h2>
<p>Light is at the center of photography. But even better? You can use light to make your subject stand out and any distractions disappear when used with intention.</p>
<p>Brighter areas of the frame will naturally attract your viewer’s attention first. When you see a scene that may feel chaotic or cluttered, try moving the important elements of the frame to a brighter area of the frame.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as moving a toddler and her blocks to the area of the playroom where the window light naturally falls. Or you can wait for a cyclist to move to a sliver of light in an otherwise shadowy city street. Or you can move your subject closer to a light source so that everything further away from it falls into darkness.</p>
<p>The scientific term for the phenomenon that is happening here is called the <i>Inverse Square Law.</i> Mathematically, it states that the brightness of anything in a given scene is 1/distance<sup>2</sup>. But you don’t need to take out your calculator every time you want to take a picture! The concept just means that the closer something is to a light source, it will be brighter than the things that are farther away from it.</p>

<p>The next time you find yourself in a setting with lots of clutter, work to find the brightest area of the room and move the activity there. Then expose for that and see how the rest of the scene melts away (without ever touching a feather duster!).</p>

			<h2>Be patient</h2>
<p>Clutter is often simple a matter of how things are arranged in any given situation. For example, the pile of mail that is currently scattered all over my kitchen counter currently looks like a terrible mess. However, if I take 30 seconds to put that mail into a neat little pile, it will suddenly look so much more organized! The same items are there, but they are now arranged in such a way that they don’t feel as though they are out of control.</p>
<p>When you have a lot of subjects in a frame so that it feels too busy, be patient. Wait for your subjects to arrange themselves in a way that is more organized. Try to press the shutter button when they are not overlapping and falling into each other but rather are distinct and separate.</p>
<p>In this scenario, I like to find the best environmental composition for the frame. I position myself here and wait for my subjects to be in activities that keep them separated. The physical separation in the frame translates as organization and can make the chaos of a scene feel more intentional and purposeful.</p>

			<h2>Clean only what you need to clean</h2>
<p>When I see a scene worth photographing, the last thing I want to do is set down my camera to clean! However, taking a few minutes to move that pile of dirty mismatched socks out of the frame can make all the difference (and save me hours of cloning in Photoshop later).</p>
<p>When you see something that looks like it could be a potential distraction, take a minute to move it. I am not telling you that you have to clean the whole house (something I am actively avoiding right now! HA!). Instead, I am telling you just to clean enough that your audience would imagine that everything outside of the frame matches what is inside of it.</p>
<p>Again, this isn’t to deceive necessarily (unless my mom is looking at my pictures…I want her to think that she taught me well and that the whole house is perfectly tidy!). Instead, it is to keep your audience focused on what matters in your photographs by removing the distractions.</p>

			<h2>Embrace the mess</h2>
<p>My life is never going to be Pinterest tidy. And that’s just the way I like it! We have a pile of muck boots by the front door and big messy smiles on our faces.</p>
<p>While I sometimes wish that things were a little less cluttered, the fact is that this mess is our reality and that we love the life we have created. That’s why I am perfectly okay capturing our mess from time to time. It’s part of our story. It’s part of our happiest memories. The mess just shows that we are so busy having fun that we don’t have time to get rid of the evidence!</p>
<p>In these moments, I want you to embrace the chaos. Most of us don’t have maids to tidy-up after us and that’s okay. We shouldn’t be ashamed of our everyday and in fact, I think that we should celebrate it! So when you see the mess and feel inspired, let it stay in the frame.</p>
<p>Those dirty dishes are evidence of meals shared. Those scattered toys are evidence of games played together. And even those finger-smudged windows are evidence of the happy little hands that are so happy to see you pull in the driveway after a long day of work. And I think those kinds of messes are worth capturing from time to time.</p>

<p>Because my kids? They are <em>always on the move</em>. I joke that even when they are sitting still, my kids are wiggling!</p>

			<h2>Shutter speed</h2>
<p>There are three variables that affect your exposure: aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. Adjusting any of these will affect how much light enters your camera and thus how well-exposed your photos will be.</p>
<p>Aperture affects how large the opening of your lens element will be. ISO affects the sensitivity of your camera’s sensor. And shutter speed affects how quickly your camera’s shutter opens and closes. This last variable is super important for freezing motion!</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>If your shutter is open for a longer period of time, your subject is going to move through the frame and look like a blur in the final shot. The faster the shutter opens and closes, the less time your subject will have to move through the frame. And the more “frozen” they will appear in the photograph.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the exposure triangle variables exist alone. You will need to accommodate the fast shutter speed by opening up your aperture and/or increasing your ISO. Likewise, you are going to find that photographing motion where there is a lot of available light will be super helpful. It will allow you to increase your shutter speed without forcing your other settings to be less than ideal.</p>

			<h2>How fast is fast enough?</h2>
<p>In my mind, one second is pretty fast. But in your camera? That’s actually really slow!</p>
<p>Think about it this way: when you do a single jumping jack, that movement takes you about one second. So in that time, you have moved your arms all the way above your head and back down to your sides. In a photograph with the shutter open for a full second, you will see a blur of your arms and legs as they go through that entire motion.</p>
<p>In half of a second, your arms still make it all the way over your head. With the shutter open for just 1/25 second, you will still see your arms and legs moving from the start position to halfway up! If you want to make it look as though you are totally frozen, you will need your shutter to move MUCH faster.</p>
<p>As a baseline when photographing kids, I recommend not letting your shutter speed go any slower than 1/125. This is the speed at which I shoot when my kids are relatively still.</p>
<p>If I am going to be photographing my kids moving slowly, such as picking flowers or walking in the part, I take my shutter speed up to 1/500. This ensures that I still freeze the motion but gives me some wiggle room with my aperture and ISO.</p>

<p>Finally, when I want to photograph dynamic movements like running or throwing a baseball or jumping on the bed, I make sure that my shutter speed doesn’t go below 1/800. Even at this speed I might get some blur in their hands, but it’s a good place to start.</p>
<p>Your camera’s shutter speed can likely move as quickly as 1/4000 or 1/8000 second. When possible, I totally encourage you to take it that fast. The faster the shutter speed, the more likely you will be able to freeze all the fun!</p>

			<h2>Focus mode</h2>
<p>Chances are, your camera’s factory settings are such that your shutter release button also controls your autofocus. This means that when you press the shutter button halfway, your camera searches for and locks focus.</p>
<p>However, this also means that as your subject moves about the frame, you might miss freezing the motion. In the fraction of a second between pressing the shutter halfway and all the way, your subject could be on a totally different focal plane, leaving you with an out of focus shot.</p>

			<p>Instead, I would encourage you to switch your camera to back button focusing in dynamic autofocus mode. With these settings, you can hold the back button focus button on the back of your camera as you shoot, allowing your camera to refocus continually as your subject moves through the frame.</p>
<p>Sports photographers and wildlife photographers have been using this system for ages. It only makes sense that we would need the same settings when photographing wild and crazy kids!</p>

			<h2>Maintain a generous focal plane</h2>
<p>When photographing moving subjects, not only do you have to accommodate the speed at which they move, but you also have to accommodate the direction in which they move.</p>
<p>For example, when my son is on the pitcher’s mound, I am often photographing him from behind home plate. Here, he is actually moving toward me. This means that when I grab focus as he prepares to throw the ball, he is going to move out of focus as he throws the ball if my focal plane is not wide enough.</p>
<p>To keep him in focus throughout the movement, I need to ensure that I have an aperture that allows for a bit of wiggle room. Of course, back button focusing and dynamic autofocus will definitely help here. But closing down my aperture even just a little bit can make all the difference in nailing focus in fast-moving situations.</p>
<p>Your focal plane will be dependent upon your aperture, your focal length, and your distance from your subject, so be sure to experiment with your settings to find what works best for you.</p>

			<h2>Choosing the right tools for the job</h2>
<p>If you are like me, you like to research your gear before you make a big purchase. I read reviews and rent items before buying to ensure that they are going to work for the way I shoot.</p>
<p>When choosing tools for photographing fast-moving subjects, you are going to want to look for some specific features. First, you are going to want a camera that has fast shutter speeds. My favorite camera bodies can go up to 1/8000 and I find that it makes all the difference.</p>
<p>For your lenses, you are going to want to know that they are quick to focus. If you have ever had a “slow” lens, you know the agony of listening to it hunt for focus as you miss your shot. Certain lenses are known for their ability to find focus quickly and those are the ones that I find myself reaching for over and over again.</p>
<p>Finally, you are going to want gear that is capable in lower light situations. Even if you aren’t photographing motion in darker settings, you will want to know that your camera can produce high quality images when you need to bump up your ISO to accommodate your shutter speed. Likewise, you will want lenses that can perform with relatively wide open apertures so that when your shutter speed needs to be fast, your lens can compensate.</p>

			<p>It was 2012. I had a brand new DSLR camera. And I was ready to take beautiful pictures of my kids.</p>
<p>Except when I went to take those photos, nothing was turning out as I had hoped. My pictures were blurry (<a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/how-get-blurry-backgrouds-photographs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and not in the background like I wanted them to be!</a>). They were often too dark. They didn’t look anything like the photos I saw from other people’s fancy cameras. And I was frustrated!</p>
<p>Luckily, I followed a photographer on social media who mentioned Clickin Moms in one of her posts. She talked about what a great place it was to learn and how friendly and talented everyone was. I became a member that same day and it quite literally changed my life.</p>
<p>Ever since, I have been urging anyone who wants to take better pictures to join Clickin Moms. It is truly the best place to learn and grow in this craft and it gets better every single day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>Finding community</h2>
<p>There aren’t a lot of people in my day-to-day life who understand why I get excited about a new lens. I don’t have a lot of friends who understand how good it feels to “nail a shot.” Most people aren’t going to be able to relate to hours spent editing or how amazing it is to find good light.</p>
<p>But at Clickin Moms? EVERYONE gets it! When I share a picture or session that I am excited about, I can share it and know that there is a whole community to be excited with me.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>And when I need someone to tell me that I should definitely buy that new camera bag I have been eyeing? My Clickin Moms community pulls through (this totally happened last month!).</p>
<p>Photography can be a pretty isolating venture. Clickin Moms makes it so that I don’t have to be alone because I have thousands of friends who get it right here!</p>

			<h2>Getting the answers I need</h2>
<p>Those first pictures I took with a DSLR? They weren’t so great. And I had no idea how to make them better.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Clickin Moms is that when I have a question, there are thousands of photographers who have answers! All I have to do is share what is perplexing me on the forum and everyone can weigh-in.</p>
<p>This was a huge help as I was figuring out how to take better pictures. If I couldn’t find a tutorial on the subject I needed, I could make a quick post and there was always someone there to help. Whether it be a question on which lens to buy next or how to pose a family, there is always someone ready to help at Clickin Moms!</p>

			<h2>Receiving helpful critique</h2>
<p>I will be honest. When I first joined Clickin Moms, the LAST thing I wanted to do was have my photos critiqued. I saw all of the work from so many talented artists and I was pretty sure that they were going to shout, “You’re <i>terrible!</i>” and kick me out of the club.</p>
<p>And you know what? There are places where this could have very well happened!</p>
<p>Luckily, Clickin Moms is not that place. Critiques here are kind and encouraging.</p>
<p>That is not to say that they don’t point out areas for improvement (because that wouldn’t be helpful, either!). Rather, Clickin Moms critiques praise you for what you are doing right while showing you how you can be better.</p>
<p>When I finally mustered up the courage to put my work out there, I found that critiques were one of my favorite aspects of the forum! They motivated me to take my work to the next level and I received invaluable advice as to how to make my photographs look the way I wanted them to look.</p>
<p>I never felt beaten-up by critiques at Clickin Moms. Instead, I felt <i>empowered.</i></p>

			<h2>Learning from the best in the business</h2>
<p>My photography heroes? Most of them are Clickin Moms members! And that means that I have access to artists who are creating work that inspires me and who can help me create work that is inspired.</p>
<p>Even better, these photographers are sharing tutorials all the time. I am constantly learning from their lessons and am always amazed by the tips and tricks they share.</p>
<p>When I want to learn something specific, I can go to the tutorial forum and find lessons divided by topic. Whether I am seeking advice on basic shooting techniques, trying to hone my Photoshop skills, or wanting to grow my business, I can easily find tutorials that meet my needs.</p>
<p>The best part is that if I need clarification on anything in the tutorial, I can just ask! I get to interact with rockstar photographers and learn from them in a friendly environments…it’s truly amazing!</p>

			<h2>Staying motivated</h2>
<p>There are days when I don’t feel like taking pictures. Heck, there are <i>months</i> where I have trouble finding the inspiration to pick-up my camera!</p>
<p>Not only am I able to commiserate with other Clickin Moms when I hit these creative ruts, but I am able to find ways to get through them and overcome them.</p>
<p>Whether it be the monthly forum photo contest, our annual Clickin Walk, any number of community shooting projects, or the yearly Photo Hunt, <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/37-contests-and-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms always has something going on</a> to nudge me toward my camera again.

			<h2>Incredible diversity</h2>
<p>At Clickin Moms, there are photographers in just about every photographic genre. We have experts in portraiture, street photography, macro, landscape, wedding, and wildlife. Our community is made of photographers who have been in business for years and others who are lifelong hobbyists.</p>
<p>This means that no matter what I want to photograph, there are people at Clickin Moms who are available to teach and inspire me. I am always finding myself exposed to new kinds of work and that keeps me excited by the possibilities of what I can capture with my camera and motivated to keep learning and growing.</p>

			<p>As photographers, creating a designated workspace can often be an afterthought. For both professionals and hobbyists alike, the portability and flexibility of photography can force us to reason that wherever our laptop lands should be the office for the day.</p>
<p>But what if having a space designated for work made us better photographers? Whether you have a corner office in a high rise or have staked-out a corner of the kitchen to call your own, having a space that is <i>yours</i> can make all the difference in getting work done well.</p>
<p>That said, even the most extravagant of workspaces can work against you if it isn’t planned thoughtfully. These office design tips will help you create a work environment that lets you get things done no matter the size or location.</p>

			<h1>1.) Make your office a distraction-free zone</h1>
<p>I am a mom to five children. My office is in my home. Let’s get real: distraction-free is not a possibility for me. Ha!</p>
<p>That said, I have taken steps to remove <i>unnecessary </i>distractions from my workspace. This means there is no television in my line of vision, I am away from the home responsibilities that might be calling my name (no laundry or dishes in here!), and I keep all of the school papers, bills, and other “work” that demands my attention in a separate space.</p>
<p>While much of my job requires me to be accessible by phone and email, I even keep those distractions away when I am on an photo editing deadline. Multitasking has been proven to be an inefficient way of accomplishing tasks and so I do everything I can to ensure that I am able to focus on the singular task I have in front of me.</p>

			<h1>2.) Keep your workspace clean and organized</h1>
<p>Nothing is less inspiring than clutter and filth! Having a space that allows you to feel as if you have room to move and function in an orderly manner is sure to increase your productivity.</p>
<p>I understand that there are some personalities whose desks are bound to be messier than others. Still, those desks can have a system of organization that works for those people. Knowing where things are will save you time and spare you the stress of searching for things that should be easily accessible.</p>
<p>Luckily, office organization can be super cute and affordable! I love the yearly planners from Rifle Paper Co. as they are beautiful and colorful and have ample space for me to write down appointments and deadlines. IKEA, World Market, and Target are all wallet-friendly spots that have adorable options that are sure to make you love you space while keeping pens and papers organized.</p>

			<h1>3.) Fill your office with inspiration</h1>
<p>Think of ways that you can create a space that makes your creative heart sing! Consider having art on the walls, a photo of the kids on your desk, an inspirational quote in your line of vision, or even a shelf of books that you find inspiring. Simply being in the same room as these objects can help you tap into that part of your brain that loves to create.</p>
<p>One of my favorite sources of inspiration is music. Whether it be a classical concerto or Cardi B, having music on helps me to focus and fuels my creative drive. I have a Sonos sound system throughout my home with a speaker in my office to ensure that I can have my playlist at hand at all times.</p>

			<h1>4.) Consider how color affects your creativity</h1>
<p>There are all kinds of scientific studies that will tell you that color affects the way your brain functions (orange is supposed to inspire creativity, FYI). However, I am here to tell you that whatever colors make you happy, THOSE are the colors you should include in your office space.</p>
<p>Do you love clean and monochromatic? Roll with that in your workspace! Do you wish that everything could be bright and vibrant all the time? You have my permission to throw the whole rainbow at your office! The point is, don’t hesitate to forego trends and use color to make your designated workspace a place that makes you smile.</p>
<p>While I am a girl who LOVES color, my office is stark white. Not only does this make the relatively small space feel bigger, but it allows the room to be a blank canvas where I can add color for pops of happiness. Even better, I can change things out for different seasons or moods (I particularly like changing my throw pillow covers!) to keep my office fresh and exciting.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<h1>5.) Make yourself comfortable while you work</h1>
<p>I can guarantee that if my hiney is hurting while I am editing photos, I am not going to sit there for long! Having a place to sit that is comfortable is often a secondary consideration but is truly SO important to creating a functional workspace.</p>
<p>A chair with cushioning is helpful and I love one that is adjustable so I can work at different heights. When I want to really work on my posture and core muscles, I swap my chair for an exercise ball that is surprisingly comfortable AND helps keep me in proper alignment.</p>
<p>Of course, comfort goes beyond your desk chair! I always keep throw blankets and a sweater close by in my office so that I don’t have to leave my space should it get chilly. You will be amazed at how something as simple as a basket of blankets can boost your productivity and keep your workspace cozy and inviting.</p>
<h1>6.) Fill your workspace with proper lighting</h1>
<p>There is nothing…I repeat NOTHING…worse that fluorescent lights. If you are in a space that has them, turn the switch off and fill your space with lamps. I promise it will increase your desire to go to your office 100%.</p>
<p>While I of course want you to choose light fixtures that you adore, the most important variable here will be the lightbulbs in those fixtures. To create lighting that most closely matches daylight and maximizes productivity, choose a bulb between 5000K and 7000K.</p>
<p>LED lights can last up to 50 times longer than traditional bulbs (keeping you from changing them out so often!) and are always my first choice. I also like to add dimmers to my light fixtures when possible so that I can adjust the brightness of my lights with the light coming through my windows and the brightness of my computer monitor.</p>

			<h1>7.) Keep the necessities accessible</h1>
<p>Anything that pulls you away from the task at hand is going to negatively affect your productivity. Of course, I am not telling you that you shouldn’t leave your desk for hours on end (in fact, PLEASE be sure to get up and move around at least once an hour!). Rather, I am encouraging you to minimize unnecessary trips away from your workspace.</p>
<p>Pens, paper clips, envelopes, stamps and other office staples should be right with you when you are at your desk. While it might be great for your calves and glutes to run up and down the stairs every time you need something at your desk, it is going to interrupt your workflow and make completing tasks that much more difficult. By having everything close by (and organized!) you will save yourself time and increase productivity.</p>

			<h1>8.) Keep your office healthy</h1>
<p>It can be so easy to slip into bad habits when you are busy! Keeping your office full of things that encourage health will keep you energized and ready to tackle any tasks that cross your desk.</p>
<p>I always keep a thermos of tea or water with me when I work so that I stay hydrated. Whole food bars (I am particularly fond of Lara bars!) are the perfect snack to have on hand for when hunger strikes and keep me full for a good long while.</p>
<p>I also love having plants in my office as they add a pop of color to the room and keep the air nice and fresh. When I want a little something extra in the air I will diffuse essential oils (lemon and lavender are my favorites!).</p>
<p>The portability of photography is such a wonderful thing and as someone who is juggling family and home, I am so grateful that I can work wherever I may need to be. That said, having a space that is mine and functions well allows me to be a <i>better</i> photographer in both my professional and my personal work. No matter the task, I want YOU to create a space that inspires you and allows you to be the best, most happily productive version of you that you can be.</p>
