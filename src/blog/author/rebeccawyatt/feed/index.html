			<p>Adobe Lightroom is my preferred editing program.</p>
<p>I love that all of the adjustments and tools available to me are visible and easily accessed and used from one screen for instantaneous results.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the graduated and radial filters which allow you to make localized adjustments to portions of your image bring Lightroom’s capabilities even closer to those of Photoshop.</p>
<p>But did you know that these filters can be even further refined with the use of adjustment brushes found within each filter’s panel?</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Lightroom, you probably know that both the radial and gradient filters function similarly, allowing you to place the filter on a portion of your image and apply exposure, color, and other adjustments to only that portion of your image.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is merely the shape of the filter. The graduated filter is linear while the radial filter is elliptical.</p>
<p>The only downside of the filter is that it can cover a part of your image you don’t want it to affect. For example, when I applied a graduated filter to darken the sky of this image:</p>

			<p>Here’s the secret. Did you know you can erase parts of these filters or add to them with their adjustment brushes?</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>Once your radial or graduated filter is set, in this case the graduated filter, click on the Brush tool in the filter’s panel and select the “Erase” brush. After selecting the “Brush” option, you can also press and hold the alt/option key to activate the erase brush.</p>
<p>In this instance, I used medium density brush with medium flow and a fair amount of feathering.</p>

			<p>Activate the overlay (“O”) and use the Erase brush to remove the filter from those areas where you do not want it.</p>
<p>As you go, you can toggle the overlay on and off to see how things are looking, paying careful attention to the edges. Sometimes the auto mask option is helpful here, if you have trouble getting a clean edge, try turning it on.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you accidentally remove too much. Just brush it back on with an appropriate brush by clicking Brush A or B and setting it for the appropriate density, flow and feathering.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a good idea to start with a low flow and build up for more precise refinements.</p>

			<p>I don’t know about you, but my absolute favorite time of year to photograph is summer.</p>
<p>The short, cold, dark, and often uninspiring days of winter behind me, I am re-energized by the promise of long, hot, sunny days and the feelings of freedom and ease that summer brings.</p>
<p>I know that the family photographs I make between June and September will be my best of the year.</p>
<p>Days spent outdoors, the perfect mix of adventure and everyday routine, and plenty of family togetherness make for a very good life. And nothing sets the stage for amazing family photographs better than the good life.</p>
<p>Well before the official start of summer, Memorial Day Weekend for those of us in the United States, I start to get excited by the occasional warm days where the thermometer rises a bit, giving us a glimpse of what is to come.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>And though I cannot bring myself to seize these days as vigorously as my kids, who prematurely trade in their warm leggings and boots for shorts and flip flops, my enthusiasm grows and I begin to think ahead about what I want from my summer photographs.</p>
<p>For me, preparation is incredibly valuable. Almost all of my personal family photography is in the documentary style. This means that I rarely pose my subjects or set up scenes. I take the action before me as it is and work to capture the moment authentically and in a way that makes a strong photograph.</p>
<p>And though I want my images to appear as if they were captured naturally and with ease, we all know that capturing just the right moment and just the right way is almost never easy, especially where kids are involved.</p>
<p>Taking the time to plan now enables me to seize the abundant opportunities of summer as they arrive. Planning also enables me to produce a more intentional body of work that documents the people, places, and things most important to me and my family.</p>

			<p>Without planning, I’m afraid I won’t get lucky. And in documentary photography, lucky is everything!</p>
<p>Regardless of your style, a little preparation can go a long way towards achieving better photographs. Here are a few tips to help you prepare now to capture your best summer ever:</p>
<h2>1. Write out your bucket list</h2>
<p>Take some time to think about what it is that you want to capture this summer by setting aside some time to brainstorm your bucket list. This is not a casual bucket list downloaded from the internet, rather a very personal bucket list just for you.</p>
<p>Begin the process by closing your eyes and envisioning your summer. Where are you? Who are you with? What do you see, hear, smell, and feel? Get in close and look at the details in your mind then step back and take in the entire scene. Write out every idea that comes to mind, censoring nothing.</p>
<p>You can always go back and refine your list later. Be both vague and specific. As you continue to visualize your summer, think about how your everyday routines will change, what special events or milestones will occur, what old traditions will you uphold and what new ones might you start.</p>
<p>Think carefully about what it is about these things that you want to remember. Are there old photographs you want to recreate, perhaps to show growth or change, particular groups of people to capture together, signs, foods, or landscapes that will best tell your story? Write it all down then place this list on your phone, in your car, or somewhere you can see it daily. Refer to your list regularly, cross off items as you go, and continue to add to it as new ideas come to you.</p>

			<h2>2. Get your gear ready</h2>
<p>Now that you know what you want to capture, make sure that you have the equipment you need and that it is ready to go.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to take inventory of your gear and clean it up. Inspect your camera and lenses and give them a good cleaning. Send them off for service if necessary. Then decide if you need any additional gear. Perhaps a particular lens would make all the difference.</p>
<p>Before going all in, consider renting it from a local shop or online retailer for a week or two. Renting lenses is also a great option for travel, either out of necessity &#8211; you need a super long lens for your whale watching expedition, or for fun &#8211; perhaps renting a tilt-shift to bring along on your week at the beach.</p>
<p>To hold your gear, a lightweight bag is a must! There are a million choices from shoulder bags to backpacks to small cases that fit into your larger purse. Try a few in the store and decide what works best for you.</p>
<p>Stock your bag with essential cleaning supplies like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Giottos-AA1900-Rocket-Blaster-Large/dp/B00017LSPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495117238&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rocket+air+blaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rubber bulb blower</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zeiss-Lens-Care-Pack-Microfiber/dp/B00GPVQVCO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495117466&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=camera+lens+cleaner&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=clickinmoms-20&amp;linkId=3c33a1806da06a65a1ec79450c6beab7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lens cleaner</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pack-MagicFiber-Microfiber-Cleaning-Cloths/dp/B0050R67U0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495117139&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=lens+cloths&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=clickinmoms-20&amp;linkId=d09ea650c10450ff8c7081082085f355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microfiber cloths</a>. Knowing you are prepared to remove sand, dirt, and other icky stuff will help prevent any reluctance to take out your camera in a messy situation.</p>
<p>And since summer is synonymous with water, consider investing in a waterproof camera, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DiCAPac-WP-S3-High-End-Mirrorless-Waterproof/dp/B00B8L05Y6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495117758&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=DiCAPac+Waterproof+Case+for+Mirrorless+Camera&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=clickinmoms-20&amp;linkId=efbf8e7e91805d517620ecdc40768652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">housing</a> (I use this one with my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X100T-Digital-Camera-Silver/dp/B00NF6ZGY6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495117836&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fuji+x100t&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=clickinmoms-20&amp;linkId=cfdbbcfb576aecf8506bd61714a3e1f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuji X100t</a>), or bag. There are a host of options in all price ranges.</p>
<p>Depending on where your adventures may take you, you may consider purchasing (or borrowing from a friend) a polarized filter and/or a tripod. Finally, don’t forget to make sure you have an extra battery and plenty of memory cards.</p>

			<h2>3. Have a personal growth goal</h2>
<p>Is there something you have been wanting to learn or improve in your photography? The summer is the perfect time to work on your skills.</p>
<p>Set a goal (or several) and devise a plan to achieve it. Take a class, read some books, or commit to daily practice of skills you want to improve. Be intentional about learning and growing.</p>
<p>Last summer, I seized the opportunity to learn DSLR video by taking an online class that coincided with our beach vacation. It was perfect timing. The more relaxed days afforded me the time to practice and the film I made of our trip is priceless to me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61289" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt.jpg" alt="Regardless of your style, a little preparation can go a long way towards achieving better photographs. Here are a few tips to help you prepare now to capture your best summer ever:" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt.jpg 1600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/underwater-photo-of-girl-in-goggles-swimming-by-Rebecca-Wyatt-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2>4. Plan for your final output</h2>
<p>Think about what you want to do with all these awesome photographs you will take. I hate the idea of all these memories sitting on an outdated hard drive somewhere 20 years from now.</p>
<p>Without a little planning, the business of life will invariably interfere with the daunting task of printing or otherwise presenting your work. Take the time now to consider what you want to do with your images. Perhaps you plan to blog your images, print them, create a slide show, or even sell them through your stock collection.</p>
<p>Then devise a strategy for organizing and storing your photographs in a way that will enable you to easily export for your final output. I myself love photo albums, especially from <a href="https://www.artifactuprising.com/photo-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact Uprising</a> and <a href="http://www.nationsphotolab.com/photo-albums.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nations Photo Lab</a>, and create an album of our beach vacation every summer. As a Lightroom user, I take full advantage of the tag feature to label my images. For example, after culling and editing my vacation photos, I go through and tag my favorites “beach book.” When I’m ready to create my book, I simply sort out those images, cull a little more if necessary, and then I’m ready to create my album.</p>

<p>With a little advance planning, the photographs you make this summer will be your best ever. Start now, as summertime is just around the corner!</p>

			<p>A little while back, I encouraged you to <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/be-a-better-photographer-5-reasons-to-share-your-knowledge/#" target="_blank">share your photography skills, knowledge, and passion</a> with the world.</p>
<p>Each of us, regardless of skill level, can derive tremendous benefits both personally and professionally from sharing our talents with the photographic community. I hope my article inspired you to take the leap and start sharing more.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, you were inspired but are unsure of where to begin. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</p>
<h2>1. Share with those around you</h2>
<p>There are often many opportunities to share what you know that are literally right in front of you. I’d be willing to bet you have been asked questions about your camera or your photography. Being open to answering these questions and offering advice or help is not always easy because our insecurities can get in the way. But, like all things, with practice that can change.</p>
<p>As you go through your day, look for opportunities to talk about what you love. Answer questions when asked. Over the years, I have received Facebook messages and emails from other photographs, most just starting out, about everything from processing tips to lens preferences. I am always flattered and respond promptly with the best information I have to offer.</p>
<p>Your camera is a great conversation starter when you are out and about. If someone asks you about it, take the time not only to answer their questions, but to ask them about their photography experience. And don’t just wait for people to ask you questions. Offer your thoughts and ideas when you can. For example, when on sessions, I often give tips to parents on how to get their kids interested in photographs or where to find good light in their home (<a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/why-your-messy-garage-is-a-great-location-for-photos/" target="_blank">or garage</a>!).</p>
<h2>2. Share on social media</h2>
<p>This one is easy. Everyone is on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. If you’re not, then your first step is easy. Pick one and set up an account. Most likely, however, you are already sharing your images on at least one of these formats. That’s great but consider taking it up a notch and posting a little information along with your photo.</p>
<p>What lens did you use? What was the location like? Do you have a pull-back to show your audience (I personally love to see others’ pull-backs), or perhaps a before and after of your processing or black and white conversion. Is there any special technique or composition choice you made that is demonstrated in the image? Do you have any tips that to share that the image would highlight? Talking about your process with a single image in mind is a quick and easy way to instruct and inspire others.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we can share through others accounts, too. Don’t just like a photo, take the time to leave a note to talk about what it is that you like about a photo. Is someone seeking critique? Take a moment to offer thoughtful critique that highlights what they did well and what they might consider doing differently to improve upon their image. Your kind and thoughtful critique will always be appreciated as long as it was asked for.</p>
<h2>3.  Organize a group of photographers</h2>
<p>You can organize a group of photographers either locally or online. Early in my journey, I was privileged to be part of a small Facebook group of several women learning photography and I am forever thankful to the woman who organized the group. As a group, we worked our way through our first 365 project together and continue to support each others goals and share in each others success. I’m certain each of us would agree that our participating provided the perfect opportunity to both share of ourselves and benefit from the each others generosity. The <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank">Clickin Moms forum</a> is a fantastic place to find like-minded women who would be interested in collaborating with you in an information sharing group.</p>
<p>In-person relationships are also incredibly valuable. Seek out other photographers in your area who would be interested in forming a supportive group, however formal or informal. I have formed a wonderful friendship with a local photographer who introduced herself to me at the gym. We now get together regularly for coffee to share our experiences and seek out or offer our advice. I have benefited both from her suggestions as well as thinking through my advice for situations she has encountered.</p>
<h2>4.  Blog</h2>
<p>This is an obvious but often overlooked opportunity to share your knowledge. Make a list of topics that might interest your audience and commit to regularly scheduled posts (i.e. “Tips Tuesday”). For many of us, these tips would appeal to clients who might want to learn a little more about how to take better photographs of their families, but they can truly be about anything that interests you.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what to post, think about your last (photography related) Google search. Write about what you were curious about and what you learned. Remember, you don&#8217;t need to be revolutionary. There really is nothing new under the sun, so don&#8217;t fret about being novel. Just think about being you and include your personal style. Don’t forget to seek out opportunities to write for other blogs, including the <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/blog-contributor-proposal/" target="_blank">Clickin Moms blog</a>. And wherever you blog, remember to ask questions of your audience and solicit comments to start a conversation. Take the time to read and respond authentically.</p>
<h2>5. Teach a workshop</h2>
<p>Consider offering a photography workshop focusing on what you would like to teach. You can offer a short program that teaches moms how to take a quick portrait with window light in their homes in less than an hour or teach a six week workshop on how to use a DSLR. Perhaps you have a particular passion for landscape photography or a more advanced skill. There are always other photographers looking to benefit from your expertise. If it’s too scary to go it alone, collaborate with another photographer. Finally, consider teaching children. There are many opportunities through scouting, school, and community organizations to pass this invaluable skill along to the next generation.</p>

			<p>We live in a culture of sharing.</p>
<p>Between Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, blogs, and forums like Clickin Moms, people are everywhere, sharing just about everything.</p>
<p>If you are reading this blog, you are part of a sharing community and more than likely have benefited from another’s willingness to share their knowledge with you. You are probably sharing a bit, too. Like most photographers, you are posting your favorite images to social media and blogging your recent sessions.</p>
<p>But have you taken the leap to sharing what really matters to you &#8211; your knowledge, your passion, and your skill &#8211; with the world?</p>
<p>Have you gone beyond posting beautiful images and kind comments to others and started sharing what makes you and your work special?</p>
<p>If you haven’t shared more of yourself, I invite you to consider why. Perhaps you feel you don’t know enough or that everything you know is already out there, shared by someone else. Or maybe you fear embarrassment, that no one will care or, even worse, you will look silly or just plain wrong. You might even want to share, but think you don’t have the time, or lack any idea of what you should share. You may even feel possessive of your hard earned skills and be reluctant to share for fear someone else will use your knowledge to surpass your success. Perhaps you just don’t think it’s important.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I invite you to consider that you, along with everyone else, most certainly have something to contribute, regardless of your skill level, interests, or where you are in your creative journey.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Your unique background, education, perspective, skill, and talent, make you qualified to have a voice in the creative community. In fact, the more voices we bring to the conversation, the more we all benefit.</p>
<p>If you are still feeling reluctant to jump in, let’s consider what you stand to gain by sharing:</p>
<h2>1. When you teach, you learn.</h2>
<p>The mere act of explaining your thoughts to another helps you to slow down, organize information in your mind, and evaluate your own process. As a result, you better understand what you know or how you do something. You may recognize gaps in your knowledge or alternative methods or ideas, or new ideas may be sparked. So even if you think no one cares about your idea, technique, or opinion, or you think everyone already knows what you have to teach, go ahead and teach it anyway. You will reap the benefits regardless of how many people are watching.</p>
<h2>2. Sharing allows you to create relationships and enter into a community.</h2>
<p>Sharing is the foundation of human connection. When we share what is important to us, whether it is our work, our knowledge, our ideas, or our opinions, we invite friends with similar interests to find us and be a part of our conversation. Our offering creates trust and a connection to us and our work. In photography, where our work is often personal, both to us and our clients, sharing more about our process allows people to get to know us better. The more personal our relationship, the more interested, or even invested, others are in our success, and the more likely they are to want to work with us or contribute to our success in some way. By starting a conversation, or jumping into an existing one, and giving freely of what we have to offer, we create opportunities to learn from others and to receive valuable feedback. No matter where you are on your journey, you have something to offer and even more to gain.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2022-01-07-Blog-Banner.jpg" title="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" alt="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" /></div>
<h2>3. Sharing is a less obvious, but very effective form of self-promotion.</h2>
<p>When you share knowledge, you increase your visibility to potential clients and become recognized as an authority on the topic. What you share helps define your brand and sell your work. You are engaging in content marketing, defined by the <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/" target="_blank">Content Marketing Institute</a> as “a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience – and ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.” This is one of the key strategies used for business development and sales today.</p>
<h2>4. Sharing is fun and it feels good.</h2>
<p>When we share about our passions, it feels good. We are spending time with the thoughts and ideas that stir us. Plus, we are engaged in the act of giving, which by its nature, feels good. As Ben Carson once said,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Happiness doesn’t result from what we get, but from what we give.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, when you are happy, you apt to be much more successful at everything you do.</p>
<h2>5. Personal growth.</h2>
<p>All of these benefits combined lead to both personal and professional growth. Learning, growing, making connections, and giving back are the keys to success in any area of your life, and all involve sharing yourself with others.</p>
<p>On an intuitive level, we all know that sharing is a good thing. And research backs this up with study after study showing that when you share, you start a cycle that returns greater benefits back to you. Essentially, “the more you give, the more you get.”</p>
<p>So now ask yourself, “what can I share of myself today,” and go share it! Want to share here on the CM Blog? <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/blog-contributor-proposal/" target="_blank">Submit a proposal here</a>.</p>

<p>The primary challenge photographers face in creating a realistic experience for their audience is the limitation of a two dimensional medium.</p>
<p>In order for a photograph, or any two dimensional art, to appear realistic, the viewer must appreciate a sense of depth.</p>
<p>Think back to the magic of elementary school art class when you first appreciated the difference between a house drawn with merely a square and a triangle versus the same house with the addition of converging parallel lines.</p>

<p>The more sense of depth and dimension we create in our images, the more likely the viewer will connect with a scene and commit to its exploration. Subjects will seem more life­like and take greater ownership of their place in the scene. The result is a more compelling image overall, and one that is much more likely to express your intent.</p>
<p>Depth can be enhanced through a variety of tools and techniques, both in camera and post­ processing, through the use of light, lines, color, focus, and perspective. Today, I share with you one post ­processing technique I find immensely helpful­­ the use of textures and overlays.</p>
<p>Textures and overlays are a wonderful tool for adding depth and dimension to an image. Adding these layers in varying blend modes can subtly or not­-so­-subtly alter the hues and luminosity in a way that enhances your vision. In this video, I show you how I use both a light flare overlay and a two-­tone texture to create a more three-­dimensional experience for the viewer.</p>
<p>This image is of my two daughters playing on the basketball court of our pool one afternoon last summer. It was a lovely, albeit short-­lived, moment with late afternoon sun illuminating them from above and behind. When I sat down to edit this image, I most admired the interplay between the warm orange of the girls’ skin, the basketball, and the play ball against the cool concrete and the green foliage. I also planned to reintroduce the light I had experienced that was captured by the camera. With this in mind, I approached my edit with the intention of creating a dramatic, high contrast image highlighting the girls against their environment.</p>

<p>Applying the principle that warm tones and cool tones collaborate to create a sense of depth, I selected and applied a two-­tone texture to the image. The texture’s warm orange center accentuated the warm colors of my subjects’ skin as well as their balls. The cool blues and greens swirling around the texture’s center enhanced the cooler foliage in the background and concrete in the foreground.</p>

<p>This simple addition created more dramatic tonal contrast between the subjects and their surroundings resulting in a much more distinct foreground, middle, and background. The addition of the texture had the added benefit of adding greater visual and tactile interest to the concrete, enhancing the existing lines leading the eye through the frame and to my subjects.</p>

<p>The addition of the light overlay, with its orange hue and rays, added additional dimension. The rays served as additional leading lines, directing the viewer’s eye to the subject, while the orange haze created a deeper sense of space between the girls and their background.</p>
