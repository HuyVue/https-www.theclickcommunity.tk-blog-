			<p>Do you remember doing scavenger hunts as a kid? I have vivid memories of running around my neighborhood looking for seemingly random and useless objects that, when found, brought me so much joy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That is what photography is for me today. Every day, I feel joy from driving, walking, or biking around where I live and finding hidden treasures that help me make beautiful photographs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It can turn daily life into a little game. Grocery shopping, visits to the park, school drop-off, and even filling up the car with gas become opportunities to find interesting places to take pictures of my girls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I find myself looking for color, texture, lines, repetition, light, framing, and negative space. The more unexpected the location, the greater the sense of accomplishment I feel. My favorite images are ones where I find beauty in a spot most people would have walked right past.</p>

			<h2>The driveway</h2>
<p>My older girls love to color with sidewalk chalk. They are always on board to work with me to create a chalk masterpiece on the driveway!</p>
<p>When they are entertained and happy it makes the process of taking photos so much more pleasant. And the outcome is usually much more successful, too!</p>
<p>I like to explain to my older girls that I am trying to create an interesting photo and ask for them to contribute suggestions to the project at hand. My six-year-old will independently draw an idea out on paper and ask me to help her turn it into a photograph. Sharing my love of photography with her makes the resulting images that much more meaningful.</p>

			<p>Since we are often coloring on the driveway or cul-de-sac, I usually shoot from above. This perspective helps me to avoid distractions and allows me to better capture what is being drawn. In the example below, I actually took the screen out of the window above the driveway so I could lean out and get a higher viewpoint of the wave my oldest wanted to create.</p>

			<p>If you are struggling to come up with ideas for what to draw, just ask your kids! My three-year-old suggested creating the night sky on the blacktop. I gave her a bunch of yellow chalk and taught her how to draw stars.</p>
<p>When our masterpiece was finished, I changed her into a yellow dress. I knew that would make the photo look more cohesive and purposeful. No matter your location, take a few moments to consider and adjust the color palette to create a more intentional photograph.</p>

			<h2>Tunnels and underpasses</h2>
<p>I love shooting in tunnels and underpasses. They have great light at any time of day! Not having to wait until golden hour to shoot is especially helpful to me in the summer months when the sun sets way past my kids’ bedtime.</p>
<p>When in the tunnel, be sure to periodically adjust the direction you are shooting so you can achieve a number of different looks.</p>
<p>Shooting with the light behind them can create dramatic silhouettes or dreamy backlight.</p>
<p>Shooting with the light to the side can give great dimensional light.</p>

			<h2>Art</h2>
<p>My daughters love to draw and paint! For that reason, I often try to incorporate their art into my images.</p>
<p>Try photographing your subject against a piece of seamless paper they have decorated. Sometimes I let my girls draw whatever they like, but more often than not I come up with a theme to give us some direction.</p>
<p>Be sure to pay attention to what your subject is wearing so each element in the image looks intentional. Here, I had my daughter change into overalls to go with the painting theme.</p>

			<p>Another fun way to incorporate art into a photo is to take a portrait using the art your kids bring home from school as the backdrop. This adds interest and meaning to images (and always makes me feel a little less guilty about throwing out the art since I now have a photographic record of it). In addition, my kids feel a sense of pride when they see the finished product.</p>

			<h2>Flower beds</h2>
<p>I often take portraits of my girls amongst flowers. And you don’t need an endless meadow of wildflowers to make this work.</p>
<p>Instead, I am talking about the flowers that grow in the manicured areas on the side of the road or even in your own front yard. You really only need a small pocket of flowers to make it look like you were in the middle of the countryside!</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to pull over when you see some pretty blooms and take a quick shot. Just make sure that you and your subjects are safe if you are close to traffic.</p>
<p>In order to add interest to a flower bed image, I try to get my subjects to interact with the flowers. Throwing petals in the air, picking some blooms, or even decorating my girls’ hair with flowers all work well.</p>

			<p>In this image I used the flowers to add texture and depth to the photo. In order to achieve this both my daughter and I had to step into the flower bed. This allowed her to be surrounded by the yellow blooms with blurred flowers in the foreground and background.</p>
<h2>Walls</h2>
<p>I always have my eyes peeled for interesting walls when I am driving around. They really are everywhere when you start to look!</p>
<p>My favorites are walls that have extra texture like peeling paint or flowering vines on them. I almost always carry my camera with me so I can stop when I see a potential photo opportunity. If that isn’t possible, I will drop a pin on my phone of the location and make sure to go back within the next few days.</p>

			<p>In this picture, I just loved the purple flowers and wanted to play with <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/color-matters-choosing-right-colors-make-photos-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color theory</a>. So when I went back to take a photo, I was sure to put my daughter in yellow to compliment the purple blooms.</p>
<p>A little planning can really help take an image to the next level. If she had been wearing a different color this image wouldn’t have been as striking.</p>

			<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>Windows aren’t just a great light source for images, they are also a great backdrop! Try changing your perspective when shooting and use the window so it is behind your subject as a backlight. From this angle, the window effortlessly frames your subject.</p>
<p>I will often get my girls to help me decorate the windows with a certain theme. The images above were taken two years apart around Valentine’s Day. By incorporating a theme into your imagery, you can add character, charm and a sense of whimsy.</p>

			<h2>Find the beauty in your world</h2>
<p>I often have other photographers tell me that their gas stations or sidewalks don’t look as beautiful as the ones near me. I used to think the same thing about the scenery around me!</p>
<p>But now, I simply look a little harder for locations with potential. I am not always successful, but I continue to observe my surroundings everyday as I am out living life.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to see the photographic opportunities around you, try to turn it into a game. Over the next week challenge yourself to find a wall, tunnel or flower bed to use as a backdrop. If your kids are old enough, ask them to help spot prospective locations. Alternatively, create a photographic opportunity around your home using chalk, paint, or the boatload of art your kids bring home from school.</p>
<p>More than anything, let these suggestions and examples help empower you to take notice of your everyday surroundings a little differently. Once you start looking, you will realize the opportunities around you really are endless!</p>
<p><em>“To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place…I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.” -Elliot Erwitt</em></p>

			<p>As we all must do more often than we would like, I was folding laundry the other day and I noticed how cool the texture of the used dryer sheet was.</p>
<p>I have seen amazing images of people shooting through zip-lock bags, metal pipes and even crystal bracelets.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I decided I should try shooting through the dryer sheet.</p>
<p>This particular dryer sheet had been through the dryer twice as I was forgetful and didn’t bother to put a new one in. I pulled it apart a bit so there would be a hole in the middle that I could focus through.</p>
<p>I then attached the dryer sheet to my lens with a thick elastic band being careful to keep the hole in the middle. I used my center focal point when shooting so that I would definitely be able to get focus.</p>

			<p>I was expecting the addition of the dryer sheet to add a neat texture to the image but was completely surprised at what it did to the light coming into the camera when I pointed the lens directly at the sun.</p>
<p>I placed my girls on the chair you can see in the photos below and took pictures of them at sunset. My settings were: ISO 320, f/3.2, 1/250.</p>

			<p>I was concerned that this may have been a lucky shot so I tried using my dryer sheet flare techniques in some other situations.</p>
<p>When you use the dryer sheet without the sun directly hitting the lens you get a much more subtle effect. As you can see here, my daughter is blocking the light with her body and the dryer sheet provides a soft, dreamy effect to the image.</p>

			<p>Happily, I was able to recreate the flare effect on numerous occasions with different pieces of dryer sheet (always used twice because that makes it much easier to pull apart without it tearing).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there is a bit of luck involved, as you don’t have a lot of control over where the flare ends up. However, this is one of my favorite parts about my dryer sheet experiment as it forced me to let go of control and embrace the surprise!</p>

			<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re in your car every day.</p>
<p>With school runs and trips to Target it&#8217;s very rare that I spend a whole day without driving somewhere. This alone makes my car a perfect photo location.</p>
<p>However, there are many other great reasons to take your camera along the next time you go for a drive.</p>
<h2>1. Framing</h2>
<p>Framing is a powerful compositional tool that helps draw the viewers’ attention to the subject of your photo.</p>
<p>Cars are jam-packed with framing opportunities. Open doors, windows or the space between the headrest and the seat all make perfect frames for your subject.</p>

			<h2>2. Textures</h2>
<p>I love including textures in my images. Texture has the ability to make a two-dimensional image seem three-dimensional and allows the viewer to access their sense of touch when viewing your image.</p>
<p>Car windows are great for incorporating texture. My very favorite technique is shooting through the car window, from inside or outside, when it is covered in dew or raindrops.</p>

			<h2>3. Reflections</h2>
<p>Including reflections in your photography is a simple and effective tool to make your images stand out. The surface of a car, both the paint and glass, are reflective and provide countless opportunities to capture reflections.</p>
<p>Adjust your position when you are taking photos until you are able to see the reflection clearly. When editing I increase contrast and clarity on the reflection to make it stand out even more.</p>

			<h2>4. Leading lines</h2>
<p>Leading lines are a key element of design. Lines help draw the eye to an important location or subject in an image.</p>
<p>You can use your car as one long leading line. I like to sit my subjects down next to one wheel and shoot at an angle allowing the car to lead straight to them.</p>

			<h2>5. Flare</h2>
<p>Interesting light can really make or break an image. One of my favorite ways to play with light is to incorporate lens flare. This is accomplished when shooting into the sun and backlighting.</p>
<p>Flare, however, can often be too overpowering and make an image look too hazy for my taste. Fabulous results can be achieved by using parts of the car to block some of the light entering the camera.</p>
<p>Try changing your position as you shoot and see how the amount and type of flare changes as you do. Having a subject that is entertained really helps here as it gives you time to experiment with the light.</p>

			<h2>6. Contained subjects</h2>
<p>I have two young children and they like to move! Sometimes this makes it difficult to take their photo, especially a portrait with eye contact.</p>
<p>My favorite perk about the car is that my subjects are contained, literally strapped down in car seats, which gives me lots of time to take multiple shots without having to worry about them moving. I frequently place my kids, and sometimes the dog, in the back of our SUV to take their photo.</p>
<p>The car acts as a frame while also keeping the subjects in one position with their attention on me. This would be much more difficult if they were just standing out in the open.</p>
<p>I also like to sit my girls on the hood of our car, especially at golden hour when the hood reflects the beautiful sunset colors and clouds in the sky.</p>
