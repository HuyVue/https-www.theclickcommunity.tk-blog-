			<p>Have you ever found yourself wanting to try new editing techniques? But then you open your editing software and realize you have no idea where to start?</p>
<p>I have good news! You don’t have to spend a ton of extra money on presets and actions. In 2018, Adobe made some major changes to their Camera Profiles (now simply called <i>Profiles</i>). This handy little feature is all you need to start experimenting with your editing.</p>
<p>If you have never heard of or used Profiles, you are not alone. It used to be buried in a hard-to-find menu where no one would ever find it! However, now this feature is right at the top in the Basic panel so that it’s easy to find and access.</p>
<p>Simply go to the “Profiles” menus at the top of the Basic panel. Then click on the “Browse” option. Here is where you will find a treasure trove of premade styles that you can easily apply to your images.</p>
<p>In this quick video I will walk you through accessing the Profiles menu:</p>

			<h2>Basic Profiles</h2>
<p>There are Profiles made specifically for editing RAW files. These Profiles give you a good, neutral starting place to begin your edit.</p>
<p>For example, the Monochrome Profile is what Adobe feels is the best starting place for a black and white edit. It not only removes the color but aims to give you contrast with a nice range of tones from black to white.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Adobe Portrait focuses on rendering really nice skin tones. The default here feels just a touch to warm to me, so I simply cool it down in my editing workflow. However, I know plenty of photographers who prefer a warmer edit like this one. It’s all about personal style!</p>
<p>Adobe Vivid saturates the images without over-saturating the skin tones. This one is nice for landscapes that have people in them. It allows you to get beautiful color in the sky and in plant life without making the people in the frame look too neon and alien.</p>
<p>It is important to clarify that these aren’t mean to be your final edits. Rather, they are a good starting point to which you can add your own extra adjustments.</p>

			<h2>Creative Profiles</h2>
<p>Creative Profiles are designed to give you a more…you guessed it…<i>creative </i>look and feel in your images. These can be used on RAW, JPEG, or TIF files.</p>
<p>As they are meant to be more stylistic in nature, these are not meant to be neutral starting points. Rather, they are intended to be a “look” that you apply on top of your more basic adjustments.</p>
<p>My advice is to fix white balance, exposure, and anything else that you may see that needs tweaking first. Then play with the Creative Profiles to see if there is anything that you like.</p>
<p>My favorite feature here is the “Amount” slider. You can pull the slide up and down to add as much of or as little of the creative effect as you want! You are in total control.</p>

<p>The Artistic Effect is edgier than your basic clean edit. It has stronger color shifts. But again, with the Amount slider, you can modify the intensity to your liking. Here I have illustrated the 10 available Artistic effects.</p>

			<h3>Black and White</h3>
<p>The Black and White creative profiles will be more dramatic than the monochrome profile in the Basic panel. These will vary in contrast and dynamic range. Some will have a matte effect in the shadows while others will deepen the blacks. Some profiles will have bright highlights while others will have muted highlights.</p>
<p>The key when using these is to choose the one that works best with the individual image and with your personal style. Experiment with them all to find those that you like the most.</p>

			<h3>Modern</h3>
<p>The Modern creative profiles are meant to mimic popular trends in editing styles. Whether it be a matte effect, desaturated color, or an extra pop in contrast, the modern effects are fun to play with!</p>
<p>I do caution, however, that trends are just that: trends. And as trends come and go, you don’t want to go too wild with these as they can leave your photos looking dated in the long run. So while I encourage you to have fun playing, be sure to use these with intention.</p>

			<h3>Vintage</h3>
<p>The Vintage creative profiles replicate the look of film. While it doesn’t specify a specific film stock, it does give you different toning that makes certain films so desirable.</p>
<p>I love how these profiles add a throwback look to my photographs. I like to start with one of the vintage profiles and then layer on grain to enhance that retro feel.</p>
<p>What I love about Creative Profiles is that they are independent<i> </i>of any of the other sliders in the develop module. This allows you to choose a profile and then you are still able to apply a favorite preset on top of that.</p>
<p>In addition, you can modify any of the other panels and sliders in Lightroom on top of the profiles to get the look want. Once you find the style that works for you, you can then save the profile as part of a preset.</p>

			<p>With these goals in mind, I decided to go with Modern 09. I like how it mutes the greens and dulls the blacks a bit. I played with the amount slider to help control just how much the profile affects the final image. I also added some grain to the edit to give it a little bit more of a film look. Finally I cropped it and brightened it up just a little bit using the tone curve.</p>
<p>Profiles give me the flexibility to streamline and customize my editing process.</p>
<h2>Before and After</h2>
<p>The difference in my final product is subtle but definitely more polished. The greens are less neon, the blacks have a beautiful matte effect, and by pulling up the shadows on kitty’s face I have ensured he is the focus point. The little bit of added grain gives the final edit that unique film look that I love so much.</p>

			<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you love a beautifully backlit photo!</p>
<p>There’s just something about that dreamy, golden hour light that makes a picture sing.</p>
<p>You probably also know that backlit photos can be tricky! You have to slightly underexpose your subject so that you don’t blow out your background.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to brighten your subject in post without leaving that tell-tale halo that looks unnatural and overly edited. I’d like to share a simple way to brighten your subject quickly and precisely using Lightroom CC Classic’s new color and luminance range masking tool (this also works in Adobe Camera Raw.)</p>
<p>Don’t let that techy sounding name frighten you! The tool is incredibly easy to use and makes editing in Lightroom faster and more precise.</p>
<p>The tool can be found in the Adjustment Brush (keyboard shortcut “K”) which I&#8217;ll be showing you below. It can also be found in the Graduated filter, as well as the Radial filter because let’s face it… editing tends to be a bit more complicated than a straight line or a circle.</p>
<p>This tool gives you the precision that you never had in Lightroom. To explain it simply, you can quickly brush on an adjustment (like exposure) and then using the range color selector, tighten up the selection to more accurately choose what you want to adjust. It is actually quite simple. Let me show you&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my original photo exported straight from RAW. The sun was setting quickly behind the tree line just as we saw this really cool old car sitting in the parking lot as we were wrapping up our senior portrait shoot. You can see the sky is slightly blown out and my subject is quite dark.</p>

			<p>Next, I used my adjustment brush and painted over her face, arms and hair very quickly and not very precisely.</p>
<p>I scrolled to the bottom of the adjustment brush tool to “Range Mask” and chose “color” from the dropdown menu. I clicked on the eye dropper tool which activates the range color selector. Then I just click and drag a small portion of her skin under her chin to tell Lightroom which colors to zero in on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like what it chooses you can click another spot and it will make a different selection. You can see in this case, it very accurately highlights only what I want to brighten up.</p>

			<p>I then make exposure and warmth adjustments to her skin. Because I have only highlighted her skin and hair, it doesn’t add yellow to her teeth, eyes, and shirt. I can go back and do the same thing on her shirt if I want to brighten it up as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, if I wanted to pop the blue of the car without taking away from the overall warmth of the scene I can easily highlight the blue, use the color range mask tool to pinpoint only those colors you wish to enhance and then increase my blue saturation.</p>
<p>It really is as easy as that! You can see below I’ve brightened my backlit subject in just 3 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>quick global adjustments</li>
<li>painted on exposure and warmth adjustments to her hair and skin</li>
<li>brightened her white top without adding additional yellow.</li>
</ol>
<p>She’s gone from dull to wow in less than a minute&#8217;s time.</p>

			<p>Which lens should I buy?</p>
<p>This seems like such a simple question.</p>
<p>In fact, I am asked this all the time. My kids are swimmers and I have been capturing them and their teammates in summer league, club meets, and now high school meets for years. I’ve also been the high school football photographer for a season, the middle school track team photographer, and I love to catch a quick shot of my adorable 8-year-old neighbor when she has a soccer game. I LOVE sports photography. I love the action, the emotion, and the feeling of capturing “the shot!”</p>
<div style="display: none;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55735" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports.jpg" alt="What lens(es) do I need for kids’ sports?" width="736" height="1444" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports.jpg 736w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports-214x420.jpg 214w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports-428x840.jpg 428w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports-200x392.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports-400x785.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-lenses-do-I-need-for-kids’-sports-600x1177.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></div>
<p>To determine what gear you need, it is important first to consider what makes a great shot in sports. First and foremost, a clearly defined subject is extremely important. When you look at your photo, is it absolutely certain who the hero is in that shot? The right focal length on the lens can help you achieve that.</p>
<p>Secondly, does the subject “pop?” Do they stand out against any distractions in the background? The use of aperture will help you achieve this.</p>
<p>Finally, is your subject in focus? Have you stopped the action without hands or feet blurring? When you zoom in, is your subject crisp and clean? The shutter speed and the ability of the lens to focus quickly will help you achieve this.</p>
<p>There are so many other factors that go into a great sports shot: light, emotion, composition, shooting angle, sense of place, processing… the list goes on! However, if you focus on the three items above, you can elevate your photos from a mere snapshot to photographs that have impact and tell a story. The lens that you choose plays a critical role in your ability to do this. Let’s take a look at the elements of a lens and how they affect your picture.</p>
<h4><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-55357" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-840x560.jpg" alt="boy high jumping by Andrea Ferenchik" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boy-high-jumping-by-Andrea-Ferenchik.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></h4>
<h2>FOCAL LENGTH</h2>
<p>Focal length at its most basic is how wide or narrow the angle of view is that the lens can take in. If a 50mm lens is considered similar to what the eye can see, a number smaller than that would be considered a wide angle lens. So on the extreme end of this, the fisheye will take in a 180-degree angle of view and a lens larger than 50mm would be considered a telephoto. Telephoto lenses work extremely well in sports photography because they allow you to fill your frame with just the amount of the scene that you are trying to focus on. Consider this versus an iPhone photo. While the quality on your phone has gotten quite good, you are not able to zoom in and fill your frame with your subject easily due to the extreme wide angle of the phone lens.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>At longer focal lengths, you get lens compression. Lens compression basically means it pulls everything together. It makes the background seem closer, or people or items in a line seem closer together. This is in contrast to a wide angle lens that exaggerates distance. Think once again of your iPhone. Have you ever tried to take a picture of a beautiful moon only to realize it seems small and so far away on your phone?</p>

			<p>One other thing to consider is whether you shoot with a crop sensor or a full frame camera. Most entry level DSLRs come with a crop sensor, which is actually a good thing in sports photography because it takes the focal length of your lens and makes it even longer! What does this mean? In its simplest form, it means that the camera actually “crops” your photo in closer when it takes the picture. In the example of a Canon Rebel, the crop factor is 1.6. So you take your lens and multiply it by 1.6 to get the focal length for your lens. Example: 24-105mm on a full frame camera equates to a 38.4-168mm on a crop sensor camera. It means you can get that much closer across a large soccer field and maintain maximum detail. That’s great news!</p>

<h2>APERTURE</h2>
<p>I believe the use of aperture is the single most important thing you can do to instantly improve your sports photography. Aperture is basically an opening in your camera lens that opens up wide, or closes down to a small hole, and controls whether you have background blur or an incredibly sharp photo from front to back. When your lens is “open wide” your subject is in focus and everything in front of and behind them falls into a lovely blur.</p>

			<p>The level of blur created by aperture is increased when combined with a telephoto lens zoomed all the way into its highest number. Huh? That just means that if you take the lens that came with your camera at 18mm with the aperture set at f/3.5 and you compare that to a picture taken with a 200mm lens set at f/3.5 and you are the same distance from your subject, the 200mm will show far more blur in the background and your subject will really pop. Here is an example of 2 photos taken with a 70-200mm lens, with the aperture consistently set to f/2.8. The first one taken at 70mm shows much less blur than the second one taken at 200mm, which really isolates the main subject.</p>

			<h2>SHUTTER SPEED</h2>
<p>In sports photography, your shutter speed should typically go no lower than 1/500th of a second and ideally 1/1000th of a second or higher. At speeds around 1/500th or lower you will begin to see the extremities blur, especially in your fast moving sports like football, lacrosse, tennis, and soccer. So what do you need to keep your shutter speed high? You need light! How do you get more light? You have 2 choices. You can either raise your ISO (not my first choice, and can be troublesome on older cameras as you introduce an unacceptable amount of digital noise,) or you can lower your aperture. Most professional photographers shoot with lenses that open all the way to f/2.8. The trouble with this is that those lenses can get expensive. We’ll talk about that in a minute!</p>

			<h2>IMAGE STABILIZATION</h2>
<p>Or vibration compensation, or vibration reduction, or optical stabilization… it is called something different by each lens manufacturer, but essentially this feature is extremely helpful in sports photography, especially with telephoto lenses. At the higher focal lengths, hand shake can become a real issue. A high shutter speed helps with this, but with the addition of image stabilization you can get sharp, shake free photos at even lower shutter speeds than you would be able to without it. In my opinion, it is worth the extra money.</p>
<h2>JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION! WHICH LENS SHOULD I BUY?</h2>
<p>Now that we know what elements make a great sports photo, as well as the elements in a lens that help us achieve that, it really gets down to price! Fortunately, there is a wide range of options available from the most budget conscious beginner to those who are ready to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>For someone new to photography or extremely budget conscious, a great, affordable choice is the 70-300mm f/4-5.6. It is available from all of the major lens manufactures (Canon, Nikon, Tamron, Sigma) at a very reasonable price and includes image stabilization. Many starter camera packages come with this lens as an addition to the 18-55mm “kit lens.” The Canon and Nikon versions are both less than $500 and are 4.5+/5 star rated on Amazon. The Sigma version is even more affordable at less than $150.</p>
<p>There are many pros to this lens including its ability to zoom in very tightly on your subject and isolate them from the background, creating beautiful background blur even at f/5.6. This is ideal for outdoor sports with great natural light such as soccer, daytime football, baseball, etc. Where it gets tricky is when the action moves indoors.</p>
<p>Sports such as wrestling, volleyball, basketball, etc. will find it much more challenging to achieve high shutter speeds due to the apertures that do not open wider than f/4 at 70mm and f/5.6 at 300. You will have to bump your ISO up to compensate for this. Unless you have a newer camera, you might find that you don’t like the amount of noise you see in the resulting photo. If this is your only option, “embrace the grain” and focus on proper exposure and great composition. No one is going to notice a grainy photograph if it is well exposed, at the peak of action, and has great emotion!</p>

			<p>As your budget gets larger, the next logical choice is a 70-200 f/2.8. This can get very expensive ($2000+) from the 2 big name camera manufacturers but there are more affordable options at great quality available from Sigma and Tamron. I personally own the Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 VC Di and I have never regretted it! It comes with a 6-year warranty that recently covered a full repair of the autofocus system! I had rented this lens so many times that I decided it was time to buy it.</p>
<p>Renting is great way to try before you buy. A couple of great options are <a href="https://www.borrowlenses.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borrow Lenses</a>, <a href="https://www.lensprotogo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lens Pro To Go</a>, or <a href="http://aperturent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aperturent</a>. Once you decide to buy, purchasing a used lens is another great option. Sites like <a href="https://www.keh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KEH</a> fully evaluate the lenses and rate them accordingly. You can buy a “like new” lens for significant savings.</p>
<p>If you find yourself shooting an indoor sport and cannot afford the 70-200 f/2.8 lenses, a less expensive option is the 85mm f/1.8. The Canon version costs $350 and allows you to zoom in fairly close and open the aperture very wide. If you shoot with a crop sensor camera, you get a bonus of an additional 51mm of focal length for an equivalent of a 136mm lens making this a real contender for indoor sports.</p>
<p>If light is typically not an issue, Tamron offers a multi-purpose lens that allows you to shoot wide and set the scene all the way through tight close-ups. This is their 28-300 f/3.5-6.3 Di VC PZD. This is not a cheap lens but essentially takes the place of 2 lenses at $849. I wouldn’t recommend this lens for indoor sports due to the fact that it can only open as wide as f/6.3 at 300mm, but would be a good option for outdoor daytime sports.</p>
<h2>DON’T THROW AWAY YOUR KIT LENS!!</h2>
<p>While the typical 18-55mm lens that come with your camera will not produce great action shots, don’t underestimate its value in giving your photos a sense of place. Balance your action shots with shots of the field, the participants, or the stadium. If you can, get up close or shoot down low to give your image a more thoughtful composition.</p>
