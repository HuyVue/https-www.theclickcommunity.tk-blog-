			<h2>Use an app that gives you more control while shooting</h2>
<p>It may feel limiting going from your DSLR to your mobile phone for photography, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>Sure, your big camera has a thousand knobs and dials to control every aspect of your photo. But did you know that there are apps that will allow you to have more control over the images you take with your phone’s camera too?</p>
<p>Look for an app that allows you to easily change your settings. An application that lets you have full control over exposure, white balance/color temperature, ISO, shutter speed, and focal point will allow you to get more intentional results in any shooting situation. By having the option to control these factors, you’ll begin to feel more creative with the images you’re producing from your mobile phone.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Also, just like shooting in RAW is recommended in order to have the most latitude in photo editing, the same is true for your mobile photography. Utilize an app that allows you to shoot with your phone in RAW format so you have more control during the editing process.</p>
<p>These are some favorites that allow you to have more control over the final image than your phone’s built-in camera:</p>
<p><a href="https://vsco.co/store/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCO</a><br />
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy-jai-fU4QIVEdvACh1veAb4EAAYASABEgJtN_D_BwE&amp;sdid=KKTGD&amp;mv=search&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIy-jai-fU4QIVEdvACh1veAb4EAAYASABEgJtN_D_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!332983200181!b!!g!!lightroom%20cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightroom Mobile</a><br />

<a href="https://camera.plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camera +2</a></p>
<p>The more you understand the app you’re using to take your photos, the better your images are bound to turn out. It’s important to take the time out to really learn how to maximize your available apps just as you would learn to better operate your DSLR.</p>

			<h2>Consider photographic elements</h2>
<p>It’s easy to feel like taking a photo with your mobile phone is nothing more than a quick snapshot. You pick up your phone, snap the photo without much thought, then toss your phone back into your purse and continue about your day.</p>
<p>When you’re shooting with your DSLR, however, I’m willing to bet that you take the time out to really plan. You evaluate your surroundings before you begin shooting. You observe the light and contemplate how you want to use it. Then you start looking for the perfect composition, the ideal color combinations, and other photographic elements that you can incorporate.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? It should be no different when you’re shooting with your mobile phone. Before you start snapping away, you should still be taking all of these factors into consideration.</p>
<p>A photo taken with any camera will be elevated with good light. Using <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/better-snapshots-elements-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compositional techniques</a> to guide you viewer to your subject will make any photo more impactful. Perspective, <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/color-matters-choosing-right-colors-make-photos-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color theory</a>, and texture will all add to the value of your photos. The camera does not dictate any of these variables…you do!</p>

<p>Avoid falling into the trap of always grabbing those quick and mindless snapshots with your phone. Instead, slow down and take a moment to really think through the photo you want to create before you press the shutter button.</p>

			<h2>Treat your phone’s camera like a DSLR with a prime lens</h2>
<p>The best thing about prime lenses is how they push you to be creative. Unlike a zoom lens, with a prime lens you have to move your feet and switch up your POV while you’re shooting in order to avoid all of your images looking the same.</p>
<p>When shooting with your mobile phone, keep this same frame of mind. Make sure to remember to move around and utilize different angles while you’re shooting to add variety to your photos.</p>
<p>When you’re shooting don’t be afraid to get closer to your subject for a macro-like shot. Look around you and take note of all of the opportunities to capture things both above and below you. Take a few steps back so you can capture the wider shots that include the environment. Crouch down for the closer shots that create intimacy with your viewer.</p>
<p>Step outside of your box and really push yourself to realize all that you can do with your phone by simply changing your position. Instead of thinking of your phone camera’s single focal length as a limitation, look at it as an opportunity to shoot differently.</p>

			<h2>Take the time to edit your photos</h2>
<p>If you feel like your photos taken with your mobile phone are lacking a bit of polish, you may just need to spend more time with your editing process.</p>
<p>Having more control over your camera and shooting with more intention are both necessary steps in the process to take a quality photo. However, editing your photo after you’ve taken it can really elevate your mobile photography.</p>
<p>When you’re editing your photos from your DSLR, you often enhance the basic factors such as the brightness, contrast, and saturation. You may also focus on more in-depth editing such as color toning and using the healing tool to remove distractions in the frame.</p>
<p>Go beyond simply adding a filter to your photo and get more in depth with your editing to really enhance your mobile phone photos. Some of my favorite apps to edit photos are:</p>
<p><a href="https://vsco.co/store/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: They have awesome presets that you can then edit for a more natural and custom look.<br />
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Snapseed</strong></a>: I love this app for in-depth editing, especially it’s Healing and Portraiture tools.<br />
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lightroom Mobile</strong></a>: this app allows you to upload your presets so you can keep cohesiveness between your mobile phone photos and your DSLR photos if you desire.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/using-lightroom-mobile-make-life-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Lightroom Mobile to make your life on the go easier</a></strong></p>
<p>If you want to improve your mobile photograph skills, you need to take more control, slow down and take your time, and shoot with intention. With practice, you might be surprised at what type of art you can create with this tool you carry around every day.</p>

			<h2>A Project 365</h2>
<p>What is a <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/why-you-should-start-365-photography-project-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project 365</a>? It’s a challenge that requires you to take at least one new photo every day for an entire year.</p>
<p>The best way to improve your skills in any given capacity is to practice with intentionality and consistency. With this being true, it should come as no surprise that a project 365 would help you to become a better photographer. You’re practicing with purpose <i>every day</i>!</p>
<p>Picking up your camera everyday helps you to become more familiar with your settings. In this way, operating your camera becomes second nature.</p>
<p>Also, shooting a new photo every day pushes your creativity. Chances are, you will get bored if you try the same old thing 365 times.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>And that’s good! Because it means that you will try new things! And when you try new things, you grow as an artist.</p>
<p>Daily shooting encourages you to look at your everyday surroundings with an evaluative eye. You will work to see your world in new ways. You will allow yourself to capture things you may not have considered to be worthy subjects in the past. And you will find yourself appreciating the photo-worthiness of your everyday on a whole new level.</p>
<p>A common challenge when taking on a project 365 is remaining consistent. Taking a photo everyday can be really hard to keep up with!</p>

			<p>Here are a few tips to help you stay the course in completing a project 365:</p>
<h3>Join a group to help keep you accountable.</h3>
<p>Being a part of a dedicated group will help keep you motivated <i>and</i> they can provide encouragement along the way.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know where to find your 365 group? Come join our <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/topic/434286-2021-clickin-moms-365-project-start-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms-led 365 project on the forum</a>. Here you&#8217;ll be cheered on and motivated by other members and our Clickin Moms Mentors. (If you&#8217;re not already a Clickin Moms member, <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come join us</a> and get started with our 365 group today!)</p>
<h3>Allow yourself grace.</h3>
<p>If you miss a day (or three) that doesn’t mean you have to give up on the project completely. Remember that you are human which means you aren’t perfect. Sometimes you may have to go back and make up days. And that’s okay.</p>
<h3>On days you feel extra inspired, take extra photos.</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, there are going to be missed days on your part. It’s inevitable, really. There will be days when you forget or just plain feel uninspired. On days like this, reach back into that archive of photos you took on previous days where you felt super inspired and use those to fill in the gaps. This isn’t cheating, it’s called making it work.</p>

			<h2>The “Shoot-like-film” project</h2>
<p>When photographers could only work with film, every single press of the shutter button cost money. There was no going back. There was no peeking at the back of the camera to see how things turned out. Instead, the photographer had to slow down, be intentional, and do everything in her power to make every shot count.</p>
<p>As digital photography began to replace film photography as the dominant medium, a bit of that pressure was relieved. No longer did we have to get it right every single time. We could just shoot a thousand frames and keep the five that turned out right!</p>
<p>Add to that an abundance of storage options and it might seem that there is no reason to wait for the “decisive moment.” But I have found that when we take time to be more mindful, to slow down, and to shoot as if our digital cameras had film inside instead of memory cards, our best photos become even better.</p>
<p>A shoot-like-film project is exactly what it sounds like. You treat your DSLR as you would a film camera, meaning you only have a limited amount frames to shoot (ideally 24 or 36).</p>
<p>This project helps you slow down and really consider the scene before you shoot. It causes you to mentally plan before you click the shutter.</p>
<p>Through this project you become a more patient photographer who waits for the decisive moment to shoot versus shooting through the moment in hopes that you capture it.</p>
<p>If your goal is to become a more thoughtful photographer that takes their time, a shoot-like-film project is perfect option for you.</p>

			<h2>A Composition Challenge</h2>
<p>Composition is a huge factor in the impact that your image has on its viewer. Starting a composition challenge is a great way to practice building your photography skills. It allows you to explore various genres, locations, and light while allowing you to seek out opportunities to strengthen a specific area of your photography.</p>
<p>Try giving yourself a new compositional rule to explore each month. Or maybe take a photo of the same thing multiple times using different compositions. Or perhaps you can seek out various compositions as they happen naturally and capture them with your camera. However you decide to approach this project, the key is to make composition the primary focus.</p>
<p>Here are a few compositional techniques you can aim to improve on with this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule of thirds</li>
<li>Diagonals</li>
<li>Leading Lines</li>
<li>Pattern</li>
<li>Symmetry</li>
<li>Framing</li>
<li>Negative Space</li>
<li>Juxtaposition</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat this project like a fun scavenger hunt! Head out with your camera and a list of the compositional elements you want to capture. Give yourself an hour or two to cross off everything on your list. You can even grab a photog friend and make it a fun adventure for two!</p>
<p>Training your eye to actively look for these elements to incorporate into your images will help the process become second nature when you’re shooting.</p>

			<p>Remember the days when Snapchat was the go-to spot for those fun 24-hour video shares? Yeah, me neither! That&#8217;s because Instagram swooped in with their own version called Instagram stories and all but wiped Snapchat off the map.</p>
<p>At first, many were offended and outraged by Instagram’s blatant copying. But now that it&#8217;s been here a while, it&#8217;s safe to say that most of us have embraced stories. Combined with the image-fueled Instagram feed, Instagram stories has become an awesome feature and useful tool for those of us who use the platform for business and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Integrating the feature into the already existing app is appealing because now users don’t have to leave the app to have access to that content.</p>
<p>So why is Instagram stories so great? Because it provides an opportunity for you, as a brand, to show your users (comprised of possible leads) the individual behind the curated feed.</p>
<p>Stories gives you the opportunity to connect with your followers and give them a peek into who you are beyond your more polished business ventures.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can use your Instagram stories to share more of yourself behind the brand.</p>

			<h1>Share behind the scenes</h1>
<p>Everyone loves getting a sneak peek behind how the magic is created. Your Instagram stories is the perfect place to provide that!</p>
<p>There are several opportunities for providing an enticing look behind the scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You can show your setup</b> for taking a particular photo you’ve shared on your timeline. This is particularly useful for still-life/flatlay photography.</li>
<li><b>You can share a behind the scenes of a session</b> with your clients. You can take a photo with your clients and tag them (bonus points if they share the photo on their own stories) or you can hand the camera over to someone else and have them shoot you as you’re shooting your clients to give your users a look at you in action.</li>
<li><b>You can show yourself prepping for a session</b>. People love being able to relate to others, so connect with them by sharing your process to prepare for a session. Whether it be packing your camera bag, finding a parking spot, or location scouting, almost all photographers can relate to the work that goes into a session before it even happens! Your followers can see the similarities you share as well as where your prepping process differs from theirs.</li>
</ul>

<p>To effectively share a behind the scenes In your stories, simply post a photo on your timeline then mention in the caption that you have a behind the scenes shot in your stories for your followers to take a closer look behind the process. Your followers will appreciate getting that little sneak peek into your process.</p>

			<h1>Share extra photos not meant for your timeline</h1>
<p>You gave your clients 30 photos they’re in love with, but you obviously can’t share all 30 of those photos on your timeline (even though you’re in LOVE with all of them). By the third photo share from that same session your followers have probably already lost interest in seeing the session on their feed.</p>
<p>This is where stories comes into play. You can use your stories to share some of those extra photos that might otherwise flood your timeline.</p>
<p>Your stories is also a great place to share photos that might not fit the aesthetic of your super curated feed. You can freely post them into your stories without worrying about them disrupting the flow of your grid.</p>

			<h1>Use stories to direct your followers off Instagram</h1>
<p>Instagram is an awesome platform, but you should definitely avoid putting all of your eggs in one basket. Be certain to have other ways to connect with your followers outside of Instagram alone.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Imagine Instagram shuts down tomorrow or your account gets wiped-out (my heart starts racing just IMAGINING this!). Your whole list of followers is gone in the snap of a finger. Now what?!</p>
<p>How else are you reaching your followers on a regular basis? Do they know you have a blog? Do they ever visit it? Do you have an email-based newsletter you send them on a regular basis?</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>If your answer those questions is no, then you definitely want to consider broadening your approach. The more ways you can connect to your audience the better. Not only will you and your brand be at the forefront of their minds, but you will be equipped to continue communicating with them should Instagram no longer be effective.</p>
<p>Use Instagram to direct your followers OFF of Instagram and TOWARDS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your website</strong> (you didn’t do all that work in building it for nothing, so make sure they see it!)</li>
<li><strong>Your blog</strong> (with all that helpful information you take the time out to package together into nice little tutorials for them)</li>
<li><strong>Your newsletter</strong> (that you’re using to connect with them on a regular basis)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Share your personality</h1>
<p>This is my favorite part of using Instagram stories! This is where you can cut loose a little bit and share more of your voice beyond your structured feed.</p>
<p>Let people get to know more of you and your personality by talking directly to the camera. Your followers will feel drawn in as if you’re right in front of them and addressing them directly.</p>
<p>I know it may seem scary at first, but thankfully you can watch your video back before you post it. This means you have the opportunity to delete and re-record it if needed.</p>
<p>There’s really nothing to be afraid of! The more you practice, the more comfortable it becomes.</p>

			<h1>Share the things that inspire you</h1>
<p>A great way to inspire others is by sharing with them the things that spark your own creativity. This is also another great way to share things that might not otherwise fit into the look of you feed.</p>
<p>Some sources of inspiration you can share with your followers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspirational quotes that made you think. </strong>Chances are, if those quotes inspire you they will also inspire your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Funny memes that made you laugh. </strong>Everyone welcomes a lighthearted chuckle (but also try not to offend)!</li>
<li><strong>Songs you’re currently listening to. </strong>This is another way to connect with likeminded followers and we are all looking for new music to add to our playlists.</li>
<li><strong>What book you’re currently reading or a good book you’ve read in the past. </strong>Give your audience a chance to connect with you over a great read!</li>
<li><strong>TV shows you’re loving at the moment. </strong>Bond with your audience over the latest must-watch TV or share something new with them that you have been loving. Seriously, who doesn’t love discussing the drama that’s been unfolding on their favorite show?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sharing things that inspire you is also a great way to connect with your followers and encourage engagement from them beyond your professional work. Posting about your current faves provides your followers an opportunity to comment or jump in your DMs and express their mutual love. It’s the perfect way for you to form real connections with your audience.</p>
<p>Are you currently maximizing your Instagram stories as a tool to connect with your followers? Be completely honest with your answer!</p>
<p>If the answer is no, it’s time to think about how you can up your Instagram game! Start with the suggestions above and make stories work for you and your brand.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make it stressful! Instagram stories is your place to have fun! It’s where you can share the face and voice behind your brand and let your followers have a more personal peek into your world.</p>
<p>Forget your worries of having a perfect feed and growing your Instagram and instead focus on connecting with your followers via your stories.</p>

			<p>Anytime I hear people talk about taking a self-portrait, I also hear about how intimidating or scary it can be to jump in front of the camera.</p>
<p>But I don’t think it has to be scary or intimidating at all, especially considering it’s just you and the camera.</p>
<p>Taking self-portraits can and should be a fun (and honestly, sometimes funny) experience. Here are 5 tips to help you have a successful self-portrait session.</p>
<h2>1. Tell a story</h2>
<p>Before you set up your self-portrait, it can be helpful to decide on the story you want to tell. Your story doesn’t have to be super elaborate, just have in mind the message you want to convey.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on your story, it becomes easier to decide what you want to wear, what you want your backdrop to be, your posing, etc. Deciding on the details comes after you’ve decided on what you want your self-portrait’s story to be as a whole.</p>
<p>The story I wanted to tell for the following self-portrait was the story of hope &#8211; of me seeing the light among the shadows. This helped me decide to wear something fairly simple (a t-shirt) and use dappled light against the side of the house, positioning myself in one of the bright spots facing the sun, with a big smile.</p>

<p>For this self-portrait I wanted to tell the story of solitude and loneliness. I knew I wanted it to be a low-lit portrait and I chose a pose where my body is very closed off, almost as if I’m protecting myself from my surroundings. My clothing is minimal to express vulnerability and rawness.</p>

<p>Here I wanted my story in this image to be quiet confidence. I knew I wanted the lighting to be fairly simple and my body language to be pretty relaxed with a smile. I also decided to go without makeup, because I wanted to feel confident in my skin without any enhancements and portray that in the photograph.</p>

<h2>2. Get creative</h2>
<p>If you’re feeling shy about being in front of the camera, you can take a creative self-portrait that doesn’t even incorporate your face. This is a good way to get comfortable taking self-portraits without completely putting yourself out there.</p>
<p>You can take a faceless self-portrait where you use your body language to convey your message.</p>

<p>You can also focus on a body part besides your face. There’s legs, hands, etc. So many body parts to choose from so don’t feel limited to just your face!</p>

<p>There’s so many ways to avoid having your face in the frame if you’re uncomfortable when you’re first starting out with self-portraits. All it takes is a bit of brainstorming to come up with a concept that allows you to be present yet anonymous at the same time.</p>
<h2>3. Incorporate a person/item to interact with</h2>
<p>Figuring out what to do with your hands in a self-portrait can be super awkward. Do you include them in the frame? If so, what are they going to be doing? Should they be posed? Should they be relaxed?</p>
<p>There’s so many options, and sometimes it can be overwhelming to figure it all out. Incorporating an item or person into the frame for you to interact with can make these decisions so much easier.</p>
<p>Incorporating flowers gives you something to hold AND can double as a way to take a faceless self-portrait.</p>

<p>When in doubt, hands in the hair always works for me. Again, incorporating flowers automatically gives your hands something to do and incorporates another interesting item into the frame.</p>

<h2>4. Be realistic</h2>
<p>Don’t go into a self-portrait session thinking every photo is going to be a keeper. Because they’re not. It’s just not possible. It’s going to be just like any other session you do. There’s going to be times when you catch yourself blinking, or you look constipated, or your pose is awkward.</p>
<p>Out of maybe 100 frames I take (and yes, I can take that many frames for a 30-minute self-portrait session), there’s only about 20 I keep and consider editing. Then out of that 20 there’s usually only about 5 I actually end up liking enough to share.</p>
<p>Realize that you’re not perfect, but your flaws are what makes you unique. So jump in front of the camera anyway and embrace them!</p>

			<h2>5. Have fun!</h2>
<p>Taking self-portraits should be a way for you to get to know yourself and build self-confidence. It doesn’t have to be super stressful or intimidating at all. At the end of the day, no one even has to see the photos if you don’t like any. Simply scrap them and start over with a new idea!</p>
