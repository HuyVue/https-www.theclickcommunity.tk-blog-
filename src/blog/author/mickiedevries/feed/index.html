			<p>Have you ever heard the phrase, “She has a light in her eyes?” It means that someone has a sparkle. That there is something about her that is lively and fun. It’s a good thing!</p>
<p>In photography, having a “light in her eyes” is equally important to making a subject look full of life. Except that we call them “catchlights!”</p>
<p>Let’s talk about exactly what catchlights are and how we can make them appear in our portraits.</p>
<h2>What are catchlights?</h2>
<p>Catchlights are caused by a light source that produces a reflection in the eye. Without catchlights, eyes tend to look flat. This does not make for the most pleasing portraits. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<p>Which one of these portraits looks more appealing to you? I think we can all agree that the one with catchlights gives the eyes more dimension and sparkle to his eyes. This translates to a more lively subject and creates amore pleasing portrait overall.</p>
<h2>How do we create catchlights?</h2>
<p>To capture catchlights, need to point your subject toward the light source. In doing so, the light source is reflected in the eyes.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>When you are outside this means you want to position your subject so that the sun’s light is reflected in the eyes. This doesn’t mean you should have your subject look directly into the sun! That would hurt and it really doesn’t make for the most flattering pictures. You do, however, want your subject to look into the general direction of where the light is falling.</p>
<h2>Where to place your subject</h2>
<p>Think of a big field surrounded by trees on three sides and a large open field on the fourth side. Picture the sun is still relatively high in the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where should you have your subject look?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have him look directly into the trees nearby, the eyes will be dark because your subject is looking into a dark area.</p>
<p>But if you turn your subject and have him look toward the open space of the field, it’s a lighter area that will in turn likely give you a catchlight in the eye. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I alway try to face my subjects looking out to the biggest available space to catch the light reflected in their eyes.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of a field I frequently shoot in next to my house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If my subject is the blue X, I will get the most light into her eyes if I have my subject face north. If I have her face another direction I would want to put as much distance between her and the trees as possible to allow more light into their eyes.</p>
<p>Another easy way to get catchlights even when it’s overcast is to shoot down on your subjects and have them looking up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This scenario will produce catchlights on the gloomiest of days as the light in the sky will reflect their eyes.</p>

			<h2>Using reflectors and flash to create catchlights</h2>
<p>So what do you do if looking toward the sun isn’t an option? What if your desired background is different than the one that allows you subject to face the sky?</p>
<p>Flat, dark eyes are still not ideal in this scenario. Therefore we need to employ some extra tools and tricks to get light in the eyes.</p>

			<p>An easy way to bounce light into the eyes is to use a reflector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also tend to wear a white shirt when I’m shooting to act as a reflector if I’m shooting close to my subject (not better than a reflector, but it can help!).</p>
<p>You could also use flash to create light and produce catchlights in your subject’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In much the same way that you would have your subject faces the direction of the sun, you could position them in such a way that they are facing the flash. The reflection still creates the same liveliness, and you get to choose exactly where it goes.</p>

<h2>Catchlights indoors</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve talked about achieving catchlights outdoors, let’s explore getting catchlights indoors. I love using window light to create indoor portraits. Catchlights are just as important here as they are in outdoor portraits.</p>
<p>When using a window to create a catchlight, I place my subject near the window. Then I like to turn my subject on a 45 degree angle. This gives a bit more dimension to her features and creates a more interesting overall light in the photo. I am careful to ensure my subject is still facing enough of the window to catch the light in her eyes.</p>

			<p>Both of these images were taken in the same location in my house. In the first shot, I don’t have her facing enough of the window to get good catchlights. Her back eye has no light in it and her closer eye has a weak catchlight.</p>
<p>On the second shot I had her angled a bit more towards the window. This slight shift in her position produced beautiful catchlights.</p>
<h2>Where catchlights should fall</h2>
<p>For the placement of your reflection within the eye, having the catchlight in the 10 or 2 position (as if the eye were a clock) is ideal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the catchlight is too centered, it can make it seem as though the subject is in pain with a light shining directly into their pupils! This positioning allows for light to fall down on the subject (which creates flattering light as opposed to uplighting) without making it look as if he is being blinded.</p>

			<p>Of course, in controlled studio situations it is a bit easier to control where your catchlight ends up. And yet you can still have some control over where the catchlights fall when shooting outdoors.</p>
<p>Try switching up the angles you choose to shoot at. Move your subject in relation to the light. And keep an eye on what you are seeing reflected in your subject’s eyes. The smallest adjustments can make a big impact!</p>
<p>Catchlights are key to creating portraits that feel alive. I can’t wait to see how you use these simple techniques to capture the beautiful light in your subject’s eyes.</p>

			<p>I tend to process my images in color more than black and white. I love rich tones and color often lends emotion and depth to a photo.</p>
<p>However, there are compelling reasons to choose black and white over color.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Let’s explore the top 10 reasons for converting your images to black and white.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>There is a timelessness with black and white photos that color photos just cannot replicate. A black and white conversion can make our images look like they could be taken at anytime in history.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<p>This image was taken back in 2013 and remains one of my favorites. It reminds me of The Little Rascals (which likely dates my age quite a bit…ha!). The black and white conversion here makes it so that the colors of the play set and the kids’ clothes do not date the photo.</p>
<p>Instead, they look as though they could be kids from today or decades ago. This timelessness adds to the universality of the scene making the image that much more impactful.</p>

<h2>Emotion</h2>
<p>Color can most certainly speak to emotion. However, taking away color can allow other emotional elements (such as facial expression, body language, etc.) to really shine.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>By stripping away all the color information, you can hone in on the story of the image. We feel the emotion the artist is trying to project, rather than just viewing it.</p>

			<p>In this shot of my daughter, I am immediately drawn in by her obvious joy on her birthday. While I like the color version, I find I get distracted by the pretty colors. Her joy isn’t the first thing I notice. As the emotion is the most important aspect of the frame for me, a black and white edit is an easy choice to make here.</p>

			<p>In this photo, I really wanted to capture what it felt like to pull out your tooth. It’s something we can all relate to, but it’s easily forgotten once childhood fades.</p>
<p>Again, while the colors were fine, I felt that they distracted from the furrow of her brows and the pained anticipation of pulling the tooth out. By converting this to black and white, those details are at the forefront of the frame.</p>
<h2>Connection</h2>
<p>Black and white is perfect for showing connections between people, objects, and pets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It again allows us to better imagine how the subjects might feel rather than just looking at a pretty colors. No matter if it is a little child holding her lovey, siblings bonding, a newly engaged couple looking deep into each other’s eyes, or the married couple of 50 years sharing a laugh together, black and white is a sure way to draw the viewer into the connection.</p>

			<p>I love how photographer Vironica Golden captures her boys and their connections. In this photo, those connections are amplified by her conversion to black and white. Without the potential distraction of color, the viewer can immediately see the love and playfulness they share.</p>
<h2>Minimize distractions</h2>
<p>Often times I choose to convert to black and white solely because the colors in the image are kind of distracting. Colorful background elements may distract from the intended subject. And while my kids think that neon clothes are awesome, they are not quite so in photos (and those neon color casts! Ugh!).</p>

			<p>In this example I wanted to guide the viewer to the bubble blowing contest by eliminating all the crazy colored play clothes they were wearing. With a black and white conversion, the potential for someone to look at the rainbow of clothing first is eliminated. Instead, the viewer goes straight to their faces where they can see the intensity of the bubble contest unfolding.</p>

			<h2>Emphasize details</h2>
<p>Black and white can really emphasize details like freckles, sand, dirt, water, and any other type of texture. It allows the contrast in to shine in a way that just doesn’t happen when editing in color. I often convert to black and white if I want to really show off my daughter’s freckles.</p>
<h2>Add drama</h2>
<p>Sometimes converting to black and white can make an otherwise boring photo very dramatic. We often associate colors with emotion. However, if the color is in conflict with the drama of a scene, I find converting to black and white quite helpful.</p>

			<p>I love to do this when I have a lot of negative space, so that my subject really stands out in the frame. In this underwater image, the blue of the pool made everything feel just a bit too light and airy. By converting to black and white, it is as though she is diving into an unknown abyss, adding drama to the scene.</p>
<h2>Cover-up bad color</h2>
<p>This may not be the BEST reason for converting to black and white. But if I’m being honest I do convert when I just don’t want to deal with fixing mixed lighting or bad color casts. That said, the image still has to have a good range of tone to be a good candidate for a black and white edit. It’s not going to work in every situation, but it really can save a lot of time editing if you like the image in black and white.</p>

			<p>Take these two screenshots as an example, one showing the colored versions (sooc) and one showing the edited black and white images, which looks better for a wall display?</p>
<h2>Good range of tones/contrast</h2>
<p>Is every image a good candidate for black and white? Definitely not! Sometimes we need the color information to make a photograph interesting. I find this often happens in flat light.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this example where color is the predominate factor in making the image compelling, does it also work in black and white?</p>

			<p>In my opinion, it does not. The dynamic range of tones falls too much into the midtones. When I choose to convert to a black and white,I want it to have a range of tones from blackest blacks to lightest whites and a whole range of varying midtones in between. Even if the image meets any of the reasons for converting in this article, it will not convert well to black and white if there is not a good range of tones.</p>
<p>At times you can use editing to push the contrast of the image. Some of my favorite Lightroom methods for doing this are using the clarity slider in Lightroom or adjusting the individual color channels in Lightroom to make parts of the image darker or lighter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also love to add more contrast in Photoshop with curves layers.</p>
<p>Black and white processing isn’t always the right choice for a photograph, but when it is used with intention, it can make all the difference in communicating with your intended audience. Try playing with different images and take the time to see how it changes the mood. You may find that black and white is the key to meeting your artistic vision!</p>

			<p>Through <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickin Moms</a>, I have met the most amazing people! I could have never imagined how rich of friendships I would form when I first joined the forum.</p>
<p>Beyond teaching me so much about photography, my life has been greatly enriched by my strong friendships that developed because of our shared passion for photography.</p>
<p>Our friendships have moved to something much deeper than just having a shared passion though, we have laughed and cried together through births, deaths, and life milestones. I can’t imagine my life without the amazing ladies I’ve met.</p>

<p>I have difficult hair that is quite curly, frizzy, and thick and this product line has helped me tame my mane better than anything else I’ve tried. I have my whole family using their products and we all love them.</p>
<p>My daughter has especially benefited from their kids line. Her hair is fine and tangly and their kids line has helped immensely with keeping the tangles to a minimum.</p>

			<p>My cat specifically, haha! I have always loved cats and had one growing up. When my husband and I got married I begged him to get a cat and on my birthday, just after a year of marriage, he surprised me with an all black cat that looked just like my all black cat growing up. The next year we added one more.</p>
<p>My cat he gave me passed away last July. My son was especially devastated so we got him a kitten for his birthday. He also wanted an all black cat just like the one we lost. He has a tiny patch of white on her chin but he deemed that okay and named her Jackie.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t initially think of our cats for this list until after Jackie photobombed my diet coke shot. I liked her licking her chops so much that she and my other cat Leia (after princess Leia of course) made the list!</p>

			<p>I have always loved to read. It’s actually my favorite hobby, even above photography.</p>
<p>My perfect day is a rainy, cold day spent snuggled up in bed with a good book. I used to buy all the books for my kindle but I devour books quickly and it’s expensive to keep buying them, especially since I never reread a book.</p>
<p>Enter the library! I love getting <a href="http://amzn.to/2EBsf4u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kindle</a> books from our library. There is an endless supply to request and if they don’t have a title I want I can suggest it to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://meet.libbyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libby</a> is a great app that helps me search my library for the books they have available to request or for immediate download.</p>

<p class="m_585025576144435721gmail-p1"><span class="m_585025576144435721gmail-s1">We are so fortunate to live within 4 miles of the beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline in Holland, Michigan. </span></p>
<p class="m_585025576144435721gmail-p1"><span class="m_585025576144435721gmail-s1">We often visit during the heat of the day, but when I notice there is going to be a beautiful sunset we pack up to head for an evening swim. My favorite way to shoot at the beach is with backlighting as the sun sets over the lake, however, this adds some challenges with exposing my images.</span></p>
<p class="m_585025576144435721gmail-p1"><span class="m_585025576144435721gmail-s1">With strong backlighting, we often have to pick what we want to expose correctly &#8211; our subjects or the sky. </span></p>
<p class="m_585025576144435721gmail-p1"><span class="m_585025576144435721gmail-s1">We could, of course, use additional equipment to properly expose both with the addition of a reflector or off camera flash, but personally neither of those methods work well for me at the beach. It’s not my favorite past time to chase my children with a reflector while trying to shoot and lugging more equipment to the beach on top of what the children have already deemed “necessities” is not my idea of fun. </span></p>

			<p>For this reason, I choose to deliberately underexpose my subjects, and overexpose my sky knowing I will have to use post processing to achieve my vision for the image.</p>
<p>Finding the balance between underexposing your subjects enough to minimize blowing out the sky and not underexposing them so much that they cannot be brought back without significant noise and quality issues, can be hard. Shooting in RAW will help editing since it gives you more data to work with and greater flexibility with bringing back highlights and opening up shadows.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect with this technique and I promise it gets easier to judge the line between underexposure/overexposure as you deliberately work with this technique more. Practice also helps with knowing how well your camera will handle the noise that will be introduced when you open up the shadows on your subjects.</p>
<p>I have included my process for editing my beach shots that are backlit in the video below.</p>
<p>While I use Lightroom and Photoshop to achieve my vision, my process can be easily adapted to the combination of Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>During the summer months I often shoot at the beach at golden hour. My kids are happy to let me take photos of them because they get a night swim out of the deal. I try to make the most out of them being willing to be photographed! I particularly love getting shots of them backlit playing in the sand or water, but I also want to make the most out of the time I have with them without having all the shots look the same. Our beaches don’t offer too much in the terms of different spaces to shoot in as it is pretty much just sand and water with a very occasional tree if we are lucky. Even if your location doesn’t have different spaces to shoot in you can still get a lot of variety from any location. These tips are not specific for shooting at the beach, and are a great list to keep in mind anytime you are shooting!</p>

<p>I particularly love getting shots of them backlit playing in the sand or water, but I also want to make the most out of the time I have with them without having all the shots look the same.

<p>Even if your location doesn’t have different spaces to shoot in you can still get a lot of variety from any location. These tips are not specific for shooting at the beach, and are a great list to keep in mind anytime you are shooting!</p>
<h2>1. Backlighting</h2>
<p>Backlighting as I mentioned above is one of my favorite types of lighting and is often my go to for golden hour shooting. I often purposely underexpose my subjects so I don’t completely blow out my sky. I then use post processing to bring up my exposure on my subjects and bring down my exposure on the sky. Shooting in RAW helps tremendously when trying to shoot in between correct exposures for the subject and sky.</p>

<h2>2. Sidelight your subject</h2>
<p>As much as I love to backlight my subjects, I love that I can shoot with the sun to the side of them for a completely different look. Oftentimes even at sunset shooting to the north or south will produce shots with bright blue skies well after shooting to the west produces more of a typical sunset look.</p>

<h2>3. Shoot wide</h2>
<p>I truly fell in love with my 35mm lens the moment I first saw the images I produced with it. I love showing environment in my photos and how small my children look in our vast world. I love the context shooting wide gives of the setting my children are in.</p>

<h2>5. Change your perspective</h2>
<p>You will often find me during a shoot lying down, crouching, and standing over my children. My goal is to shoot them from all angles including behind them, in front of them, to the side, and above them. My children are used to this and as long as I don’t disturb them too much they tend to ignore me, which is just perfect&#8230; most of the time!</p>

<h2>6. Change your aperture</h2>
<p>I shoot relatively wide open at f/2, but when I want to add variety during a shoot I love to play with my aperture. For detail shots I often shoot completely wide at f/1.4 and for capturing sunbursts I will up my aperture to f/11 or above.</p>

<h2>7. Silhouettes</h2>
<p>I love silhouettes especially with a beautiful sunset. I meter for the sky which will in turn make my subjects very dark that can be enhanced with post processing if needed. If you have more than one subject make sure you have some separation between them or otherwise they will turn into a blob.</p>

<p>So this is my office space!  Not very glamorous, and as you can see decorating is not in my skill set.  I really want to change the paint out as this was leftover paint from a bathroom and it makes everything look a sickly green color, and don’t get me started on why I thought a checkerboard floor would be cool!  My tastes have changed a bit in the 11 years since we built our home.  I will say that the floor has been great for all the Play-Doh building, and paint drips that have graced its presence over the years, very easy to cleanup.  This room is long and narrow and I don’t have a wide enough lens to get it all in one shot, but the left side is my scrapbooking area and it’s filled to the brim with supplies.  The left is my computer area, and the closet holds our printers and lots of junk, er, I mean important stuff.</p>

<p>When we built the office I knew I wanted it to be a space that I could craft in (photography wasn’t even on my radar at the time), and to have a space for my children to play.  So we took the front wall and made the lower half a magnetic chalkboard using magnetic and chalkboard paint.  This wall has been well used by both children through the years.  Now that both my children are in school full time it doesn’t get as much use as it once did and that makes me sad.  My daughter especially loved to play Play-Doh on the floor as I would edit, and still does occasionally.  I have a wire that I got from the hardware store strung between two bolts that I hang their artwork from.  I love this cheery reminder of them when I am editing and they are at school.  There is a large built-in bookcase to the left and the door to the room is on the right with a shoe organizer that holds all my scrapbooking punches.  Now that I do <a href="http://www.digitalprojectlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Project Life</span></a> for scrapbooking I don’t use them too much, but at times they are still handy.</p>

<li>This is my <a href="http://www.drobo.com/storage-products/drobo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Drobo</span></a>, and I love it!  All my files are on this and it has redundant backup so that if one drive fails the others still contain the data.  I’ve had too many external hard drives fail so this along with <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Carbonite</span></a>’s online backup gives me piece of mind.</li>
<li>I used to LOVE the strawberry and cream lifesaver pops, but they don’t make them anymore.  Recently I found these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chupa-Chups-Cremosa-Tubes-Count/dp/B000NNB2XS/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427385423&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=chupa+chups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Chupa Chups suckers</span></a>, and I find them quite similar in taste.  It comes in a variety pack and my favorites are Strawberry Yogurt and Strawberries and Cream. Yum!</li>
<li>I used to have a monitor that had an adjustable height.  This one doesn’t and I didn’t like how low it was so I grabbed my husband’s Manual of Woody Landscape Plants.  It’s not glamorous, but it does the job!</li>
<li>This is a note that I wrote out in one of the CM classes I took about what I wanted my work to reflect.  I like to have it visible so I can be reminded of it.  It says soulful, narrative, and joyful.</li>

<p>I really, really didn’t want to show you all the mess that is in the closet in the office, I hid parts of it by not opening up the doors all the way.  You would think I would just clean it, but that would be a weekly project that I do not have the ambition to undertake.  I did think it was important to include my printer collection though as I do print quite a bit at home for my Project Life scrapbook.</p>
<ol>
<li>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HP-OJPro-x576dw-Wireless-Printer/dp/B00AAHMH6I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427385474&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HP+Office+Jet+Pro+x576dw+MFP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">HP Office Jet Pro x576dw</span></a> is our main printer.  My husband actually got it free to review and we were going to sell it as it’s more printer than we need, but it’s really fast and has a built in scanner and fax machine so we kept it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=C11CB53201" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Epson Artisan 1430</span></a>:  This is the printer that I use to print my project life photos, it is a great printer. I calibrate it with the <a href="https://www.xrite.com/colormunki-display/Related" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Color Munki Photo</span></a> to match my screen.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Canon Pixma Pro-100</span></a>:  This printer has never been used, but it was such a great deal that I got it in the fall.  I basically got this 13 x 19 printer for less than the cost of the 13&#215;19 paper I was already looking to buy. But since I have the Artisan printer I don’t really have a need for two oversized printers quite yet, but if the Artisan breaks I will be all set!</li>
<li>This is the <del>junk</del> I mean important stuff I was alluding to . . .</li>

<p>This is my main camera the <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/dslr-cameras/D810.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikon D810</span></a>.  I bought this gal at the end of 2014, and while we are still getting acquainted, I do love my new found cropping power over my beloved D700.</p>

<p>This is my <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikon D90</span></a>, it was the first dSLR camera I bought.  I pretty much never use it, but I hang on to it to have a backup, and because I’m hoping one of my children will want to shoot with it someday.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-45466" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-840x561.jpg" alt="Nikon and Sigma lenses" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-840x561.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-330x220.jpg 330w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-296x197.jpg 296w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-690x461.jpg 690w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-1050x701.jpg 1050w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses-869x580.jpg 869w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Sigma-lenses.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>I don’t want to get crazy and say I could sell all my other lenses, but if I did these would be the two I would keep.  One of these is on my camera 95% of the time.  I never understood when I first started out in photography how someone could fall in love with a lens.  Then I got these two, and I got it!  The <a href="http://www.sigmaphoto.com/product/35mm-f14-dg-hsm-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Sigma 35mm 1.4</span></a> is my most used lens because I love being able to provide environment in my photos, and it’s 100 times easier to direct my children if needed when I am standing close to them.  The <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-NIKKOR-85mm-f%252F1.4G.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikkor 85mm 1.4g</span></a> has the best bokeh of all my lenses.  The backgrounds are smooth like butter.  When I want to shoot a portrait, I always grab this lens!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-45465" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-840x561.jpg" alt="Nikon and Lensbaby camera lenses" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-840x561.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-330x220.jpg 330w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-296x197.jpg 296w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-690x461.jpg 690w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-1050x701.jpg 1050w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses-869x580.jpg 869w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nikon-and-Lensbaby-camera-lenses.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>These lenses round out my collection.  They don’t get used as much as the 35mm and 85mm, but I can’t part with them because they all serve a specific purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Tamron 70-300 1:4-5.6 Tele-Macro</span>:  I use this when my children are playing sports and I want to zoom in.  For being an inexpensive lens I’m always amazed by the quality of photos I take with it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikkor 24-70mm 2.8</span></a>:  This lens is so versatile and I often take this when I know I only want to bring one lens, but would like a variety of shots.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-VR-Micro-Nikkor-105mm-f%252F2.8G-IF-ED.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikkor 105mm 2.8 macro</span></a>:  I do not shoot macro a lot, but as my children are now both in school I am finding myself reaching for this lens more and more!</li>
<li><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Lensbaby Composer Pro with the Edge 80</span>:  I love to use this when I’m in a creative rut and want something more artistic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-Nikkor-50mm-f%252F1.4D.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikkor 50mm 1.4D</span></a>:  I used to use this lens indoors a lot before I got my Sigma 35mm.  It’s a great lens, but I much prefer the 35mm focal length.</li>

<p>Last winter I purchased the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras/EV-NX300MBQUUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Samsung NX300</span></a> before my family went to Washington D.C.  I knew we would be going to museums all day long, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to have my heavy dSLR all day.  This camera was the perfect solution for me.  It is so light, fits in my purse, and takes great photos.  I can use it on auto if I want to just take snapshots, or switch it over to manual for more thought out shots.  I often take this out and about to photograph our family’s life without having to carry my big camera.  I have the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras-accessories/EX-S30NB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">30mm</span></a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras-accessories/EX-W20NB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">20mm</span></a> pancake lenses, the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras-accessories/EX-F10ANB/US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">10mm fisheye</span></a>, and the 18-55 kit lens.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://store.kellymoorebag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Kelly Moore Libby bag</span></a> is the bag I store my gear in when in the house, and the bag I use to travel with my camera.  I love all the pockets it has and although it is big, it’s not overly heavy.</p>

<p>The <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Ketti Schoolgirl</span> is my everyday camera bag for when I’m out and about. I love how small it is so I don’t look like I’m armed with a camera at all times.  It can handle my D810 with one or two lenses plus my wallet and phone.</p>

<p>This is what I pulled out of my two camera bags, just the essentials like beef sticks, lol!</p>
<ol>
<li>My <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/speedlights/sb-600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Nikon SB-600 Speedlight</span></a>: I have a pretty dark house so this allows me to capture life as I want to even with less than ideal natural light.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/ECLIPSE-Optic-Cleaning-Fluid-2oz/dp/B00CLVSS3M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427386195&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Eclipse+Optic+cleaning+fluid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Eclipse Optic cleaning fluid</span></a>: I bought this to clean my sensor on my camera, but it makes me too nervous to ever try it so I use it to clean stubborn spots on my lenses that won’t come off with just a lens cloth.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slimjim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Slim Jims</span></a>: These are not usually in my camera bag but on a recent trip to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago I shoved a couple of these in my camera bag in case my children wanted a small snack.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ffcc00;">ExpoDisc</span>: I use this or Kelvin to set my white balance, and prefer this in fields with lots of grass.</li>
<li>Wet Ones: I have children, need I say more.</li>
<li>Hair band: a necessity with long hair on windy days of shooting.</li>
<li>Pez dispenser: This does not get used very often as my children are old enough to look at my camera without it, but on the rare occasion I shoot for family/friends with children 3 or younger I slide this into my hotshoe.  And of course, I make sure it’s filled with Pez for cooperation!</li>
<li>Ink pen: never know when you will need one.</li>
<li>The thingy that you screw into the bottom of your camera to use your tripod – my tripod is a Manfrotto 190XDB which is discontinued.</li>
<li>Smarties: half eaten package, my kids still like these so they come in handy for cooperation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Lenspen</span></li>
<li>Kleenex</li>
<li>AA battery: this is in my bag in case my external flash runs out of batteries, it takes 4 of them though so I’m not sure what happened to the other 3!</li>
<li>Lens cloth</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you enjoyed a peek inside my office and camera bag!  Here are five more things you may not know about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>As much as I love photography, my number one hobby is reading!  I love reading, and am always in the middle of a book.</li>
<li>I teach Kindergarten Sunday school at my church and love those little kids.  I’m pretty sure I get more from them than they get from me.</li>
<li>I love to camp in the summer, and am so glad my children love it as much as I do.</li>
<li>My first of many majors in college was Fine Art with a painting emphasis.  Fun, but not so marketable for jobs! Now I can’t remember the last time I painted, as photography is now my creative outlet of choice.</li>
<li>I used to be really shy, but no one would describe me that way anymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>I joined <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a> in April of 2011, and since joining I have enjoyed looking at the progress threads that members post.  I however, have never posted my journey, and the reason why will become evident in just a minute!</p>
<p>I admire the threads that show incredible growth in such short periods of time, my journey does not mirror those, mine was slow.  I would say painfully slow looking back, but I was often unaware of where I was in my journey at the time. I am so glad I found CM and <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMU</a> because without them I’m sure I would not have progressed even this quickly, and I use the term quickly loosely&#8230;</p>
<p>2004 was the year my son was born, and while I always loved taking photos before that, his birth made me want to document every waking moment of his life.  I did not yet own a DSLR, but I began scrapbooking and began playing around with images in Photoshop.  I was vaguely familiar with Photoshop due to my web development degree, however using it for photography was very different than using it for web graphics.  I am thankful that I have the original files from this time period as almost always the unaltered image is thankfully better than my early attempts at editing.  Here are a few from the time Alex was born until I bought my first DSLR shortly before my daughter’s first birthday in 2009.</p>
<p>I loved selective color!</p>

<p>I found all these different versions of this photo on my computer. Aren’t they great?!</p>

<p>After buying a Nikon D90 in early 2009, I read lots of books on how to get that blurry background.  I shot in aperture priority mode almost from the beginning so I could control the blur.  I however did not realize that shooting wider was resulting in blurry images.  I’m not sure why I didn’t realize at the time that my photos were largely out of focus!  I also continued my experimentation with editing, I couldn’t resist buying actions!</p>

<p>This was my favorite photo for a long time that year. Easy to see why, right?!</p>

<p>In 2010 I started and completed my first and only 365 project.  I also continued experimenting with processing and began shooting in manual.</p>

<p>This was one of my favorites from 2010 and I do still love it as it shows my daughter so unsure of her new cousin.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2011 I saw a mention of CM on a fellow photographer’s page. At the time, CM was running a promotion for lifetime memberships so I signed up on a whim.  I really thought I was quite knowledgeable when I joined; I had no idea how much information I lacked.  I’m pretty sure I need new friends because at the time I joined I was portfolio building by taking family and friend’s photos, and they raved about me.  They should not of been raving, let me tell you. I beg them now to take down my old photos from their walls, but alas they still love them.</p>
<p>I remember seeing the abbreviation wb on CM all the time when I first joined, and had no idea what that was or why it was important.  White balance (aka wb) turns out to be a pretty big thing in photography. Who knew?!?!  Even after I figured out what wb meant, I still struggled with it for a long time, and it still gives me a hard time once in a while.  I lurked on CM for quite a while before becoming active on the forum. I just absorbed all the knowledge from gifted photographers and I began taking classes from CMU.  The decision to take classes through CM, and the thoughtful lessons and critique by the amazing CMU instructors is finally what spurred on my growth.  With each class I learned new things, and my voice as an artist started to emerge.</p>

<p>After taking Fine Art and Visual Expression (aka FAVE) in the spring of 2013, I finally began to produce work that matched the vision in my head. Visualization before shooting also became more natural at this point, and very important to how I shoot and edit.  Shortly after FAVE I applied and was welcomed into <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmpro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMPro</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for reliving my journey with me! I hope it was less painful for you than it was for me. In all seriousness though, my journey was not fast, but I still progressed and made the commitment to educate myself.  I am so thankful for each step in my journey and each friend, photographer, instructor, and mentor that spurred me on with thoughtful critique and encouragement!</p>

			<p>Often, before I ever pick up my camera, I know how I will process the resulting image, and this image here is an example of that.</p>
<p>My daughter was playing outside this summer and came to the door covered head to toe in dirt and grime. Before I let her come in for a shower, I grabbed my camera and had her sit in front of my open garage just inside the shade so that the sunlight would light her, but the rest of the garage would largely fall off into shadow.</p>
<p>From previous experience, I knew that this set up works well for me when converting to black and white, and this picture was begging me to be black and white before I even took it.</p>
<p>My choice for black and white was mainly because I knew that I could play up the dirt that was covering her much more in black and white than in color. My goal for taking the picture was to document the dirt of summer, so black and white for me was a natural choice. Plus, black and white hid the awful mismatched play clothes she choose to wear that day!</p>
<p>The following video walks you through my thought process and editing steps in Lightroom 5.</p>

			<p>Most people that use Lightroom are familiar with presets used for editing in the develop module.</p>
<p>But did you know that there are also export presets?</p>
<p>Export presets allow you to save settings that you use frequently to size your photos. I know that I upload my photos to various websites for display and printing and all of these have different optimal settings.</p>
<p>It’s hard to remember how my image needs to be sized for all the sites so I use export presets to simplify this process.</p>
<p>Before you set up an export preset in Lightroom, you need to create a folder on your computer where your exported files will end up. I personally created a folder called Lightroom Exports in my Pictures folder. All of my exported files go to this one folder to keep it easy.</p>
<p>Underneath this folder I have subfolders, but you only need to create the main folder at this time. After creating your Lightroom Exports folder, open Lightroom and select a photo that you want to export. Then choose export from the file menu.</p>

			<h2><strong>Step 1:</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure the &#8216;Export to&#8217; dropdown has &#8216;Specific Folder&#8217; selected. Then hit &#8216;choose&#8217; to navigate to the Lightroom Export folder you created. Check the checkbox for &#8216;Put in Subfolder&#8217; and name your subfolder. I always name my subfolders based on the website my photo is being exported for, so for this example it is &#8216;Facebook&#8217;.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 2:</strong></h2>
<p>In the &#8216;File Settings&#8217; section, I just make sure my color space, image format, and quality are how I need the file.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 3:</strong></h2>
<p>I check the &#8216;resize to fit&#8217; box, and select how I need my image sized. This will vary according to what you need the photo for.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 4:</strong></h2>
<p>This is where I check the box if I want a watermark added.</p>
<p>I don’t always use the other sections but if you want to add sharpening or change the file name all of these sections can be opened and adjusted, too.</p>
<p>When you are finished selecting how you want your image exported, click &#8216;Add&#8217; over to the bottom left of the export window. Select the preset name and hit &#8216;create&#8217;.</p>
<p>You will then see your export preset added to the white box above the add button. After that you can press export and your file will be exported to the subfolder of the main Lightroom Export folder you created in the first step.</p>
<p>So for my example, my file will be in the Facebook folder contained in the Lightroom Export folder after it exports.</p>

			<p>What is geocaching you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, in the simplest of terms, it’s a treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Yep, you heard me right, treasure! Who doesn’t love treasure?!</p>
<p>Let me tell you my children love treasure and they love the search for it almost as much. I love that I can get outside with my children for a fun activity that involves exercise, and an awesome opportunity to location scout while still incorporating fun.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you more about geocaching first.</p>

			<p>I had first heard about geocaching through some friends on Facebook. I wanted to learn more about it so I went to the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official geocaching website</a> and checked out their geocaching 101 page.</p>
<p>From there I learned that the only thing I needed to get started was a GPS device or a GPS app on my smartphone, and an account that was free to sign up for on the geocaching website. Since I did not have a GPS device, but I did have a smart phone, I decided to go with an app for my phone.</p>
<p>There are lots of geocaching apps available, and some are free, but through research it sounded like the official geocaching app for my iPhone would be the easiest for me to use, so I purchased this for a small fee.</p>
<p>After setting up my account and purchasing the app, I just searched for nearby caches on the app, which can also be done from the website. After choosing a cache you then use the app to navigate to the coordinates where you can search for a container in the general vicinity.</p>
<p>The containers can be all shapes and sizes and are often camouflaged. We have found caches in ammo boxes, snaplock containers, and even a pinecone that was hollowed out to include just the log to record your name.</p>
<p>Containers will often have items in it that you may trade with an item of your own that is of equal or greater value than the one you take out, which is where the treasure aspect comes in!</p>
<p>My children are always so excited to find a cache that contains “treasure”. My son recently found a cache that had a National Guard coin in it and he was so amazed that someone would leave such an awesome treasure in the cache!</p>

			<p>I’m not sure how the other apps work, or how much details they give in the app, but the official app lists the approximate size of the cache, the difficulty of finding it, and the complexity of the terrain.</p>
<p>To start off, I recommend choosing a cache with an easier difficulty level, basic terrain, and a medium to large container size. My children like the ones that contain “treasure” the most, and the smallest ones do not usually include treasure due to size limitations.</p>
<p>As you gain experience though, these small ones are fun to find because they tend to be more difficult due to their small size.</p>
<p>My app also shows how recently the cache has been found, which is helpful in determining if the cache is still in the same coordinates as what is listed. I steer away from caches that haven’t been found recently as they may not still be intact. The app even has a hint feature that I have had to use on occasion to locate the cache.</p>

			<p>My initial decision to start geocaching with my children was solely based on the fact that I knew they would love it. However, I quickly discovered that geocaching is also great for location scouting. By the nature of the activity you are exploring areas around you, and the cache locations frequently take you to places off the beaten path.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful to have the opportunity to not only photograph my children doing something that they love in beautiful surroundings, but also as an opportunity to return to these surroundings with a photo session in mind. Here are some locations I discovered while geocaching that I returned later to photograph my children or family/friends in:</p>

			<h2>Tips to get you started:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geocaching.com</a> to create a free account and to learn more about geocaching.</li>
<li>Get a GPS enabled device or download an app to your smart phone.</li>
<li>Search for geocaches near you and in places you’d like to explore further with the app or website.</li>
<li>Gather small toys for trading.  Some examples might be: superballs, McDonald toys, matchbox cars, bracelets, and quarters.</li>
<li>Camera for documenting the adventure, and to snap photos of possible future photo session locations.</li>
<li>Don’t find all the geocaches in one location on one day.  Come back at different times of the year, as you will likely find that the location changes with the time of year.  I often record what month I find the location, and note what is in bloom if applicable.</li>
<li>If at all possible, stay on an obvious path for as long as possible.  The app will point you in the exact direction of the cache at all times, but this might not be the easiest way to get to the cache.  We have learned to see if paths eventually wind in the direction the compass is pointing rather than to struggle through underbrush when the compass first starts pointing East or West.</li>
<li>If you have older children let them navigate.  My nine year old loves to hold my phone and direct us to the cache locations!  While at times he needs help, for the most part I can follow behind snapping photos while he learns compass skills!</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to jump in and try it?</p>
<p>If I can do it you can!</p>
<p>I had never used a compass before trying this but it’s super easy to get started. There are over 2 million caches worldwide so chances are you have several near you just waiting to be discovered!</p>
