			<p>I started taking pictures when my kids were cute, camera-loving babies. But now? Now I live in a new world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Our family has entered the strange and exciting world of all things tween. It seemed as though the change came in an instant. We went from kid to tween without the obvious new milestones that you have going from baby to toddler.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was as if overnight we were transported from a world of playgrounds and toys into a world of cell phones, questionable clothing choices, and makeup.</p>
<p>When I finally embraced the tween world, I realized how amazing it actually is. I was inspired to begin photographing this unique age just as I was inspired to photography my little kids. And I want to let the world know that tweens are one of the greatest stages to photograph!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>What to wear</h2>
<p>The first thing that to talk about before your tween session is clothing. Clothing is truly one of the most important pieces to the tween photoshoot. It allows them to express themselves. Clothes give them an opportunity to show their style. And as such, most of tweens have a lot of opinions on what they want to wear.</p>
<p>You will want to collaborate with your clients to guide them toward clothing choices that will be flattering in photos while also letting them show their individuality.</p>
<p>My recommendations for clothing are simple. Try to avoid writing or distracting graphics on clothing. Make sure everything fits and covers everything that mom and dad need covered.</p>
<p>And do not forget about the shoes! I typically recommend anything except athletic type shoes (unless they are an athlete and that is their thing). Tweens should wear what is comfortable so that they can move freely and feel confident.</p>

			<p>Accessories are another great way to add personality to an outfit. That cell phone that seems to be glued to her hand? Let it be in the photo! It adds a sense of age and stage and someday, her kids will marvel at the “old” technology she used as a kid.</p>
<p>Other ideas for accessories are headphones (for the music lover), a camera (for the budding photographer), or a book (for the creative poet). Encourage your tween subjects to bring it all.</p>
<p><i>Pro tip: I bring my wagon to carry any clothing changes and/or accessories brought along for the session. A parent is usually in charge of the wagon while I am shooting.</i></p>

			<h2>Where to go</h2>
<p>Your location can set the tone for your entire session. As I live in the fairly large city of Dallas, we almost always venture downtown. Tweens love it! They feel older and more worldly navigating an urban environment and the photos show them as capable.</p>
<p>As a photographer, I love how the lines of city streets and architecture create natural framing. The busyness of the city is a perfect juxtaposition to my subject standing still in the midst of all the action.</p>
<p>Of course, safety is key when shooting in a busy environment. Look for quieter streets and have a parent be in charge of looking out for oncoming traffic.</p>

			<h2>The gear you need</h2>
<p>When creating tween portraits, I want to completely separate them from the background. I also want to be far enough away from them to give them some space and get comfortable with me.</p>
<p>Even though they are a bit older, tweens still can be hesitant with new people and take a bit of time to show their true selves.</p>
<p>I find that I am always reaching for my 85mm and 135mm lenses. These lenses are known to create beautiful bokeh, allowing the background to fade to blur while the subject is tack sharp.</p>

<p>A collapsible reflector is a great tool for bouncing light back onto your subjects and can even be used to create wind for some dramatic hair movement!</p>

			<p>With these focal lengths, I am close enough to have a conversation with my subjects while far enough away to not be invading their personal space. The compression from these lenses creates subject isolation, ensuring that the tween is the center of attention. All of the distraction fade away into a beautiful blur.</p>
<p>The other piece of gear I can’t do without on a tween photo shoot is a collapsible reflector. It can bounce light onto your subject to get great catchlights and illuminate their face. And if you have an assistant wave it around, it is the perfect wind source of a little dramatic movement in hair!</p>

			<h2>Invite some friends</h2>
<p>Even with the perfect clothes, the best location, and the right gear, there is something that any tween NEEDS to show her true self in front of the camera. <i>Her friends!</i></p>
<p>If you have even interacted with a twee.n you know how dependent they are on their friend crew. And can you blame them? Friends make everything better! To share this photo experience with the most important people in their lives will make them truly happy (and might get you some new clients!).</p>
<p>Of course, you want to be sure that the friends’ parents know where you are headed and what you are doing. I like to invite the friends’ parents along for the fun so that they can be 100% on board.</p>

			<p>If your group of tweens is feeling a little uncomfortable posing for the camera, try breaking the ice with some silly prompts. Have someone whisper an embarrassing secret to someone else and watch the giggles happen naturally.</p>
<p>I suggest that when starting out, keep the friends down to 3 or 4. It’s not that the extra kids are hard to control, but more people in the frame makes for more variables. You will want to be fully comfortable getting sharp focus with big groups and know how to do face swaps in Photoshop should you need to.</p>
<p>I like to start with smaller groups of friends and then have everyone come together for one big group shot at the end. I have them all squeeze together for big smiles and a sense of connection in the photos.</p>
<p><i>Pro tip: Give each friend a job! Have one be in charge of hair and another be in charge of clothes. This age group knows how to pose too, so they can help each other there!</i></p>

			<h2>Focus on fun</h2>
<p>The most important part of a successful tween photoshoot to make sure your tween is having fun. If they are, then those amazing photos will happen naturally.</p>
<p>Tweens are just starting to find their way in this world. They are just now beginning to find out what they do and don’t like. Your job is to let them shine so that they can see themselves in your photos.</p>
<p>Let them have their serious, not so smiling photographs. And take the full on laughing photographs too! Emotion is at the heart of a tween.</p>
<p>The tween stage is an amazing time to document a kid. Make the session all about them. Let them be seen and have some fun. And chances are, you will have a blast, too!</p>

			<p>New babies are small and snuggly. Toddlers are adventurous and adorable. Little kids are fun and cute. Preteens and teens…well, they are moody and kind of difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I have noticed a trend among photographers. The trend is that we stop documenting the kids when they get ‘too big’. The years of easily taking darling pictures comes to an end. Chubby fingers are replaced by awkward, lanky limbs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And beyond the challenge of waning “cuteness,” we will likely find ourselves battling for photos in the first place! I can promise you that at some point, your child is going to roll her eyes and groan, “<i>Don’t</i> take my picture!” Or your teen could be like my son and say, “Don’t put that on the internet.” And you are often going to have to respect those boundaries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But moments worth documenting don’t stop when our kids no longer need us to tie their shoe laces. The teenage years come with plenty of photo-worthy milestones and as a mom and photographer, I don’t want to miss them!</p>
<p>So, we have to figure out how to balance all of the challenges of photographing this age group. How do we honor their wishes while still capturing what matters? How do we create work we love when our subjects aren’t twirling in fields or wildflowers or blowing bubbles? And most importantly, how do we honor all of the amazingness that is this time in our kids’ lives with our photos?</p>
<p>As I navigate photographing my own older kids, I have learned some lessons for keeping boundaries while still documenting my family in a way that is true to me. Today I am sharing these lessons with you so that you, too, can photograph your teenagers with the love they deserve.</p>

			<h2>Which moments should you document?</h2>
<p>I have found that carefully choosing the moments in which I bring out my camera makes all the difference in documenting my older kids. It allows me to minimize how often I am putting the camera in their faces while also forcing me to be intentional about the shots I want to take.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>This doesn’t mean that I only take photos on special occasions. Sometimes I just want to capture my kids lounging in the house! Choosing the moments I want to document simply means that I think about who they are and what matters to them, which means that I am able to better capture what makes them special at this stage.</p>
<p>These are some of the can’t miss moments to document.</p>

			<h2>The everyday</h2>
<p>Do you remember when your little toddler would eat breakfast and it was just so cute that you <i>had</i> to take a picture of it? Well, your teen still eats breakfast too. And while there might not be an adorable mess, it can still be worth capturing.</p>
<p>Look for when beautiful light enters the rooms in which you live the most. Think about the parts of your routine that are likely going to change in a few years. Consider the habits your teen has now that are unique to your teenager.</p>

<p>Our school day often starts before the sun comes up. If I want to capture his morning routine, I need to get my photo of the day before 6:00 am. With no natural light available, I sometimes will place my Ice Light in the corners of the room to boost the light in the room. Photographing the everyday sometimes requires you to think outside of the box, but that’s a good thing!</p>

			<h2>School activities</h2>
<p>When documenting your teen’s school activities, don’t forget to get the whole scene in the frame. Capture the whole team, the entire field, and all of what makes the high school experience unique.</p>
<p>My son is in his high school band and on the school swim team. At first I thought I would need to get some giant telephoto lens that is usually reserved for wildlife. I imagined have to keep my distance and hope to find him from the bleachers.</p>
<p>Thankfully that isn’t how his first season went at all! I still stay back and out of the way. But with my 24mm or my 24-70mm on my camera, I have the range and width capture the entire scene.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/beyond-lemonade-stands-how-photograph-older-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond lemonade stands: How to photograph older children</a></strong></p>
<p>As much as I want those nice close-ups of him, I also love documenting the whole group doing what they all work hard for. Even more, this is a better representation of who he is in this activity. He is part of the group and they work together. My pictures get to capture that for him.</p>
<p>When I do want to highlight just him in the midst of the action, I am able to use a telephoto lens to zoom in on just him. When you want to isolate your kid in a school activity, try using a wider aperture to blur everyone else except for your teen. I love the 70-200 f/2.8 for this.</p>
<p>School is a major part of a teenager’s life. It’s important as parents and photographers to capture our teens’ unique school experiences.</p>

			<h2>The moments that only happen once</h2>
<p>This year my son turned 15. And the biggest rite of passage for him was getting his learner&#8217;s permit.</p>
<p>Of course that was a long day of waiting in line with tons of people. Documenting that moment would have been a little intruding to the other people and likely not allowed in the office.</p>
<p>But then he got to drive for the first time. We took him out to a neighborhood that hasn’t been developed yet and let him drive us around.. And that moment I realized how thankful I was that I am documenting this time in his life. I can look back and feel those first moments of excitement and the exact moment he grew up a little more.</p>
<p>There are not shortage of special occasions in the teenage years. First days of school, first dances, awards ceremonies, and games.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of lasts to capture. These bittersweet moments only happen once and while you might get an eye roll or two, it’s worth it to have your camera ready for them.</p>

Its wide aperture allows me to work in low light situations with ease.</p>
<p>I can also capture everything that is going on around the scene. I can document him while he practices his band instrument or while working on the little bit of childhood that he is holding on to with his Legos.</p>
<p>For those of you who prefer zoom lenses, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFPvmH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24-70mm f/2.8</a> is universally loved for its versatility and performance.</p>

			<h3>A telephoto lens</h3>
<p>When I can’t be close, a telephoto lens is a must. The zoom allows you to look as though you are in the middle of the action without encroaching upon your teenager’s space.</p>
<p>I actually didn’t have one until the summer before he started high school. I knew that I needed that reach and zoom for his school activities.</p>
<p>For me, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fj7w5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70-200mm</a> is perfect. I can stay out of the way and still get the close up shots that I want without potentially embarrassing my teen with my big camera.</p>

			<h3>Artificial light</h3>
<p>While it might not seem necessary at first, I have found that having an artificial light source is super helpful as teenagers are active at all times of day. With my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ThkJiE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Light</a>, it is so easy to sit in the corner and add just the amount of light I need. I also have portable flashes that are great for when I am outdoors or in an area that I need to bounce the flash for a pop of light.</p>
<p>Don’t be scared of adding light! It doesn’t need to look fake or flashy and it doesn’t need to take up a ton of room in your bag. A simple speed light with a bounce card can do the trick and will allow you to capture memories that would otherwise be left in the dark.</p>

			<h3>A camera in the purse</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard the saying that the best camera is the one you have with you? It’s true! Whether you are hauling your big DSLR and lenses or using your phone camera, don’t hesitate to take a picture when inspiration strikes.</p>
<p>I have a camera bag insert that I can put in any bag to protect my camera. This lets me carry my Canon 6d and my Sigma 24mm lens <i>everywhere </i>and with any bag that goes with my outfit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, my kids are sometimes embarrassed when I bring out my “big” camera at their activities and I am trying to tread lightly. I recently purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fj8mib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mirrorless camera</a> for moments like this when I want more control than a point-and-shoot yet don’t want to look like a paparazzi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It is so light and portable and people hardly notice as I snap away. The quality of the images is astounding and I am finding myself reaching for it more and more for my everyday shooting.</p>

			<p>The key is to find what works for you and your teenagers. Don’t stop documenting your kids just because they aren’t toddling around the house in diapers.</p>
<p>Instead, see them for the amazing people you have been working so hard to raise. These teenage years come with the unique challenges of hormones and hectic schedules, but they are just as fleeting as those early years. And they are just as important to capture.</p>

			<p>Photo retouching is a sensitive subject for a lot of people. No one hires a photographer to change her loved ones into something they are not! Yet at the same time, no one hires a photographer to highlight the perceived flaws or blemishes that are simply unavoidable at times.</p>
<p>This conundrum is especially present in newborn photography. In all of their perfect newborn cuteness, babies sometimes arrive with spots and splotches that don&#8217;t allow their perfect little faces to shine the way we would like. As such, my approach to newborn retouching always aims to stay as true to reality as possible while removing those things that are temporary and potentially distracting.</p>
<p>As a newborn photographer, I typically see babies in the hospital for Fresh 48 sessions and then again at home/in studio for their newborn session.</p>
<p>Before and during a newborn session it is always wise to ask the parents if there is anything specific they would like edited out of the images. Sometimes they will see little things that you would miss!</p>
<p>Most commonly I am asked to remove the scratches, milk spots, flaky skin, and baby acne from newborn photographs. All retouching decisions are ultimately left to the parent.</p>
<p>When tasked with removing those temporary skin bumps, scrapes, and flakes, utilizing the Patch Tool in Photoshop is one of the easiest, most effective tools in your repertoire. These are my steps for removing common baby skin concerns using this versatile <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmu/photoshop-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photoshop</a> tool.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<h1>Step 1: Ask the parents if they would like specific things removed</h1>
<p>This is the most important step of the entire process! Sometimes a parent will be upfront about wanting something removed, and other times you will have to ask directly. Most parent assume you will remove those little spots so that their babies are perfectly smooth, but there are others who want you to keep those realistic details in the photos. Asking will ensure that you do not offend your clients and that you set-up realistic expectations for the results of your newborn session.</p>
<p>Be sure to let the parents know that there is no right or wrong answer on how a photograph is retouched. It is truly a matter of personal preference! As a rule, everything that I retouch is not permanent to the newborn.</p>

<h1>Step 2: Duplicate your background layer</h1>
<p>Always edit on a duplicated layer! All this means is that you have made a copy of the background layer and are making edits there, but not to the original base layer. This way if something happens and you mess up (it happens to the best of us!), you haven’t altered your base layer and can easily go back and start the edit again.</p>
<p>To create a duplicate layer in Photoshop, you go to the top menu Layer&gt;Duplicate Layer. This simple step now can save you from hours of unnecessary work later.</p>

			<h1>Step 4: Draw a circle around the area you would like to correct</h1>
<p>Once you have selected the Patch Tool (it looks a little bit like an actual patch), head on over to the spot you would like to fix. Zoom in as much as you need to really see the area you want to correct and be able to select it effectively. You will select the blemish by drawing a circle around it with the cursor. You will want to have the blemish fully within the area you select but will also want to be certain not to draw around other features that you might not want affected. Once you have drawn the circle you can let go and see the patch outlined with the a dashed line that blinks (often referred to as &#8220;marching ants&#8221;).</p>

<h1>Step 5: Drag your circle to a nearby source</h1>
<p>Check the area to make sure you are including only what you wish to retouch. Then lick in the middle of the selected area and drag it to a nearby area of skin that is clear and free from blemishes. Once you release your mouse or pen, you will notice the circled area has been replaced with the clean area to which you moved the selected area.</p>
<p>When choosing your clear area, be sure to do your best to match both colors and textures. If either is off too much, your replacement will look off with a harsh line, odd color, or mismatched texture in the patched area.</p>

			<h1>Step 6: Evaluate</h1>
<p>Take a good look at the newly retouched area. Ask yourself, &#8220;Does it look clean? Are there edges that are really noticeable in the circle? Is it too dark? Is it too light?&#8221; Be mindful if you use the Patch Tool on a textured area to match up lines!</p>
<p>I recommend blinking once or twice and rechecking the area to see if you can find evidence of the edit. Sometimes a quick walk away from the computer screen can allow you to see things you might otherwise miss.</p>
<p>If you do notice something looking a bit off, you will want to try again. You can go to the menu bar and select Edit&gt;Undo to start over or you can simply try to move the selected area to a new clean spot for better results.</p>

			<p>Raise your hand if you are like me and you just <i>love</i> underwater photographs.</p>
<p>I mean y’all, it is Texas over here. It is hot, it is humid, it is just not fun to be outside unless you are in some kind of water!</p>
<p>For some of you lucky folks, that means a trip outside to your gorgeous backyard pool. But for the rest of us, our backyards lack the sparkling waters of an in-ground pool.</p>
<p>Womp womp! There go our dreams of those beautiful underwater images.</p>
<p>No way! I am here to share how you can still make refreshing summer photo opportunities happen WITHOUT an in-ground pool oasis.</p>

			<h1>The sprinkler</h1>
<p>I am old school when it comes to a lot of my parenting skills. I especially love to let the kids run through the sprinkler. There is something about pulling the water hose out in the yard, setting it up in the middle, and turning it on feeling those first few drops of chilled water that takes me right back to my own 1980s childhood.</p>

			<h3>Protect your gear</h3>
<p>If you are going to go in close to photograph your kids running through the spinklers while using a wide angle lens, the first thing you need to think about is gear safety. Last summer I  purchased the <a href="https://amzn.to/2J13IEf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DiCaPac</a>. I love not worrying about being up close to the kids as they splash around.</p>

			<h3>Take a step back</h3>
<p>A longer lens is a great tool to have when photographing kids in the sprinkler. I am able to stand back from the action and let my kiddos be as crazy as they please while still getting shots that make it feel like I am right in the middle of the fun. Even better, the compression of the longer lens makes for picture perfect sprinkler fun.</p>

			<h3>Pick the right sprinkler</h3>
<p>While any sprinkler will work for some photo magic, I would recommend getting one that the kids can run over for the best results. When I started I got the cheap-y plastic sprinkler with the multiple dials and the regular old fashion oscillating sprinkler. While I loved the way the water sprayed with the different dials, I didn’t love the way that the plastic parts were rough on their feet as they tried to leap over the water. Upgrading to a better sprinkler still allowed for backyard fun and photo opportunities without as many stubbed toes and boo boos.</p>

			<h1>The above ground pool</h1>
<p>We do have a neighborhood pool, but this year the kids asked for an above ground pool. And I can’t blame them! There is something really nice about having all the fun right in your own back yard to enjoy at a moments notice. After a particularly hot day of yard work this past week, we all jumped straight into the pool, clothes and all!</p>
<p>I was worried that the above ground pool might not make under water images as glorious as the ones that I have grown to love. But I quickly learned that underwater magic can happen in any kind of pool whether it’s in ground or above!</p>

			<h3>Consider a dome attachment</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://amzn.to/2m2dnBj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dome</a> makes all the difference when paired with the GoPro. I purchased mine a few summers ago and love having the ability to get over/underwater shots in addition to just underwater.</p>

			<h3>Let the moments happen</h3>
<p>I don’t want to interfere with the kids playing but sometimes I use gentle directions to get my shot. I might ask them to swim to me or jump in or something simple like that to get them in the frame while still enjoying themselves.</p>

			<h3>Keep your distance</h3>
<p>A long lens is also a great tool to have at the pool as well as for the sprinkler. My daughter had one of her bffs over the other day and they were in the pool for hours! When the sun began to set behind the house I saw that beautiful golden light and knew I had to capture their end-of-the-day play.</p>
<p>I tossed on my <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/lenses/ef/standard-medium-telephoto/ef-85mm-f-1-4l-is-usm/ef-85mm-f1-4l-is-usm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85mm</a> and observed from a distance. With this longer lens on I was able to stay on the patio and keep a safe distance from the jumps, splashes, and dolphin kicks coming from the kids while also taking advantage of the light.</p>

			<p>Adding water into the process can transform the way you shoot. Not only do you have to be careful with your gear, but there is an entire new element that you must take into consideration!</p>
<p>Water can be a great storyteller if you sit back and watch it. When I was first starting out I would create this perfect image in my head and try to make it in reality. This could often lead to unnecessary stress behind the camera.</p>
<p>I finally learned that I could get the images that I wanted if I stepped out of the way and let the moments happen naturally. As storytellers we can guide the circumstances of our stories, but we don’t have to control every detail.</p>
<p>I let the kids go out every night to swim when the sun is perfectly setting behind our house.</p>
<p>We have pushed dinner back to enjoy a run through the sprinklers.</p>
<p>I can ask for the best cannonball EVER!</p>
<p>I have learned that I can set-up opportunities, but then I have to sit back and wait for the moments to happen. Sometimes they aren’t the perfect way I had made up in my head, but they are perfect nonetheless.</p>
<p>I hope y’all enjoy your own backyards this summer. I know we will be enjoying ours!</p>
