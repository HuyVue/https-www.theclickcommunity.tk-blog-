			<p>I adore the fall season. The temperatures begin to cool. The trees begin to change their pigments for a breathtaking reveal of color. Apples and begin to ripen into warm vibrant hues. And the smell of pumpkin spice lattes fill the air!</p>
<p>Living in the northern Midwest region of the United States, I am lucky enough to view the vibrant fall foliage that blankets my area each season. I find myself prowling the back roads every late September and early October.</p>
<p>However, even with plenty of opportunities to see the leaves put on their colorful display, photographing autumn color takes some practice. Today I am sharing some of the lessons I have learned in my pursuit of capturing the hues of the season so that you can capture them in your part of the world.</p>

			<h2>Chase the color</h2>
<p>Fall color doesn’t all happen in the same place at the same time. Instead, it spreads in waves over the course of days and weeks. To capture it at its best, you might need to travel and chase it a bit.</p>
<p>Many publications in different regions will put out fall foliage forecasts. These anticipate what areas will be at peak color and at what time. Often, a state’s department of natural resources website will provide accurate and up-to-date information on the foliage color within the varying state parks. There are also apps that you can download to keep a watchful eye on color and plan your excursions.</p>
<p>With that said, it is important to see that these sources of information are updated regularly. Weather can be very unpredictable and alter the leaf color. Leaf color can go from not being quite at peak to past peak in under a week with the lightest frost!</p>
<p>Keep a close eye on your local weather forecasts as they will inform you on how the color is spreading and if any unpredictable weather is going to impact the foliage.</p>

			<h2>The best time to photograph fall color</h2>
<p>Now that you found <i>where</i> to photograph that fall color, It’s time to get your camera ready! After all of that planning, you will want to maximize your time.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you will want to shoot for as many hours a day as you can. However, I find that early morning and late evening are my favorite times to capture the season.</p>
<p>The golden hour sunlight will enhance the colors of the trees. Many mornings misty fog will greet you, adding a layer of texture and mystery to your photos.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/what-golden-hour-why-photographers-love-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Golden Hour and why do photographers love it?</a></strong></p>
<p>I also find that these times are somewhat quieter allowing for me to photograph the color without too many people to clone out of my final shots! I find these first and last moments of sunlight to be so peaceful and enjoy the relative solitude when photographing at these times.</p>

			<h2>Prepare for the weather</h2>
<p>While the best fall days are cool and crisp and lovely, the weather during peak leaf color is highly unpredictable. It’s best to be prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws your way so that you aren’t too uncomfortable as you work to capture her with your camera.</p>
<p>If it is raining, use that opportunity to grab that macro lens and capture rain drops on leaves. If an unexpected storm comes through and knocks most of the leaves off the trees, capture the leaves blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>My favorite weather to shoot in is overcast conditions or even a slight mist. It gives the color a rich saturation without glare.</p>
<p>If you are lucky to have beautiful golden hour light, wait until the light is fiery orange and pair it with the golden foliage for a more intense show of color.</p>
<p>Bring layers of clothing so that you can bundle-up if necessary. having a simple rain cover for your camera can prevent major disasters for your gear. Boots, good socks, hats, and fingerless gloves are all good items to keep close by if the weather takes a turn.</p>

			<h2>Allow yourself to be creative</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why I love fall so much is because it is so unique. It happens once a year for a short window and in only certain locations.</p>
<p>Allow this novelty to inspire your shooting! Instead of choosing your go-to lens for every shot, switch it up with something you rarely reach for. Even just using your everyday lenses in a new way can create fantastic results. Try changing your standard shutter speed and aperture settings to create something new.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to try some experimental techniques. Maybe you see one standing tree with color that still remains but all the other trees that surround it have lost their leaves. Use long exposure and try to pan your camera for a more impressionist feel to your imagery.</p>

			<p>Try different perspectives and angles. I love to shoot from above with my son as he holds his collected nature treasures or that basket of apples that was just picked. Get down low to capture the majesty of the trees in front of you.</p>
<p>You also don’t have to depend on nature to give you all the color. Incorporate fall tones through clothing and other environmental elements.</p>
<p>Being creative during this time of year breaks you of your usual habits and puts you into a more creative space for your fall photos and beyond.</p>

			<h2>Focus on the details</h2>
<p>If you just missed peak season for color or most of the leaves are on the ground, focus on interesting compositions, textures and patterns that surround you. Beautiful details can be found in your own backyard!</p>
<p>Find fall treasures like acorns, leaves, and produce and zoom in on the textures that make them special. Seeing these items in a new way can reveal an extra layer of magic of the season.</p>

			<p>In the photos above, I captured flowers with the added element of light from my garden bed to illustrate color of fall. You do not need to be in a prime location to capture the fall color.</p>
<p>So whatever nature has in store for you this season, work to capture it in a way that embodies your unique experience of this time of year. Tell me in the comments about your favorite parts of fall and how you plan to photograph them!</p>

<p>Macro photography teaches us patience and gives us an appreciation for detail. It helps us to slow down as we manually focus our cameras. It forces us to pay special attention to light and makes us more keenly aware of our environment. Macro photography gives us the opportunity to be resourceful and to see our everyday world with new eyes.</p>
<p>I find that these lessons apply not only to my regular shooting, but to all areas of my life! So let’s dive in together so that you can discover the magic that is macro photography.</p>

			<h2>What is macro photography?</h2>
<p>Macro photograph is simply is the art of taking close-up photographs. These photos reveal details that would otherwise go unnoticed to the naked eye.</p>
<p>You can take macro photos of virtually anything. From flowers the tiny newborn features of a newborn to sprinkles on a cupcake; these are all worthy subjects for macro photography!</p>
<p>The details that you choose to highlight in your macro photographs are what make them interesting and artistically unique to you. The possibilities are truly endless.</p>
<p>I love to show movement in my macro photography. Therefore I am always looking for lines and patterns that imply motion. Whether that be fiddle fern emerging and reaching for the light, a snail navigating through fresh dew drops, or the last standing leaf on a tree before winter arrives, I find myself drawn to the moments where we anticipate the next move.</p>
<p>As you get close with your camera, look at it as an opportunity to see in a new way. Find what interests you about this new perspective and capture that.</p>

			<h2>Lens choice</h2>
<p>Macro photography is defined by a magnification ratio of at least 1:1. For example, if my subject is one inch tall, it will appear as one inch on my sensor.</p>
<p>There are a number of high-quality lenses specifically designed for this purpose and they come in a range of prices and functionalities. Whether it’s a manual focus lens or a high-end autofocus specialty lens, you can get beautiful macro results.</p>
<p>I suggest you rent various lenses to see which one best fits your needs. If you are photographing insects and know you can’t get too close without fear of scaring them away, a 105mm lens might be the best choice as it allows you to have some distance. If you want to get closer to your subject, I suggest a 60mm lens where the working distance is might tighter.</p>
<p>I love my Lensbaby Velvet 56 lens (a deal at less than $500!). It is a manual focus-only lens but I love how it has forced me to slow down so that I can capture the exact slice of detail that I want to reveal to my viewer.</p>

			<p>If investing in a new lens isn’t an option, there are other tools available. Extension tubes and reverse lens rings are inexpensive and allow you to use the lenses you already have.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://amzn.to/32JrlMq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse lens ring</a> lets you put your lens on backwards and thus focus closer to your subject. Be sure you are purchasing the correct DSLR mount for your camera.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://amzn.to/2SEwGAf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension tube</a> is an attachment that goes between your camera body and your lens. It’s not an optical element, so there is no glass involved. All it does is get the lens further away from the focal plane allowing you to focus closer to the object you are photographing.</p>

			<h2>Macro photography tools</h2>
<p>While your lens and your camera are really the only tools you need to get started, there are some tools that can help boost your creativity and make things easier for you.</p>
<p>One fun tool is a spray bottle of glycerin. No need to wait for a rainfall or that morning dew. Spritz your subject with some glycerin (of course not an insect or live animal) and have fun with the texture and light play!</p>
<p>Having a <a href="https://amzn.to/2SIv20u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goose neck clamp</a> can also be immensely helpful to keep flowers and inanimate objects in place. The depth of field with these close focusing distances can be razor thin. Even the slightest movements can yield out-of-focus results. Having a portable little clamp to help keep things in place can make a huge difference!</p>

			<h2>The importance of background-subject separation</h2>
<p>It is so important in macro photography to achieve separation between the subject and the background. Your subject is already on a very small micro scale. It is easy for it to become lost in the environment and thus not draw the viewer’s eye.</p>
<p>You will want your subject to sit a significant distance away from anything that might be distracting behind it. I almost always shoot with a very wide aperture so that I can separate my subject nicely and create a soft uniform wash of a background.</p>
<p>You can also use light and perspective to create a more clean background behind your macro subjects. Employing the inverse square law or shifting your position in relation to your subject can help to minimize potential distractions and allow your audience to see the details you aim to highlight.</p>

			<h2>Ideas for creating compelling macro photographs</h2>
<p>The joy of macro photography is that it allows you to be more creative. You can capture an object in a literal way and show it as it really is. You can capture an object in a more abstract way by letting the colors, lines, and textures take center stage. Or you can fall somewhere in between allowing your audience to decipher the scene the longer they sit with your photograph.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to experiment and get a little crazy with your macro photography. Throw the rules out the window! Shoot from different and unconventional angles. Focus on a part of your subject that usually goes unnoticed. Try using light that is otherwise considered “undesirable.”</p>
<p>I love shooting macro photography right after a rainfall. The overcast skies render a deep saturation of color and the little water droplets all over everything add interesting texture and reflections.</p>

			<p>I try to seek out a simple, darker background so that the subject is illuminated in the light and stands out from the surrounding environment. When I find the details I want to highlight, I position myself with intention to capture them.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to use manual focus as you shoot. This will give you full control over what is in focus. Especially with subjects that move (like insects), you will find that manually focusing gives you better results as opposed to having your lens hunt for focus up close.</p>
<p>Even more, manually focusing forces you to slow down and breathe. It allows you to really appreciate the shooting process. I find that the manually focusing trains my attention and centers me in the most wonderful way.</p>
<p>More than anything, look at macro photography as an opportunity to have fun and play with photography. Enjoy having a new view of the world! With its emphasis on detail, pattern, and texture, macro photography can yield rewarding and unique results.</p>

			<p>French philosopher Albert Camus once said, “Autumn is a second spring, when every leaf is a flower.” For photographers, this sentiment means a season full of beautiful colors and moods to capture.</p>
<p>Autumn officially begins in late September. It is around this time that we begin to see a seasonal change that has long inspired photographers from all over the northern hemisphere. What was perhaps a simple tree all summer has suddenly transformed into a colorful beauty. Now it can stand on its own as the subject of your photographs. Even a tree that lost all its leaves can be special! Give that tree some beautiful dramatic light or add a special compositional component and you can create a frame with an emotional pull and powerful narrative.</p>

			<h2>Location, Location, Location!</h2>
<p>Most nature photographers will tell you that location is <i>everything.</i> And it’s true! I have been known to plan my trips in the fall around locations where I know foliage will be at its peak. I live in Manhattan, New York and while Central Park is a great location, I need more! This is when I plan a weekend getaway family trip to the Catskill Mountains. It is a short drive away and gives us an opportunity to reconnect with each other.</p>

<p>If you are unsure when color will be at its peak, there are many useful apps that can help you. My personal favorite is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foliage-leaf-peepr-find-report-fall-colors-in-new-england/id455689669?mt=8" class="broken_link">Leaf Peepr</a>. You can also visit your state’s tourism website or do a simple Google search and easily find peak fall color information for your area.</p>

<p>My son and I will often go for walks in the city and collect artifacts of fall. By positioning a few leaves in a unique way or by changing your own perspective, you can create golden backlit foliage or play-up the textures and shapes of the leaves you have access to.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to get low to the ground. Feel free to move some leaves to a better location. Don&#8217;t hesitate to make a pretty arrangement for your photo! By letting your creativity take over you can provide a fun and unexpected perspective on fall!</p>

			<h2>Capture the details</h2>
<p>The temptation of wide landscape images is hard to resist as you stare out on those vast seas of glorious fall color. However, do not forget to capture the beauty of fall in the details.</p>
<p>Autumn is a great time to explore <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/a-macrolicious-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macro photography</a>! Not only do the fall leaves have incredible color, but their texture and the details of the variations in color can be incredible up close. You may not think that macro photography can be emotive and have sensory components, but it truly can. During this time when everything living is slowly fading and making way for a cold season to come, the details can really hone in on that narrative.</p>

			<h2>Know Your Light</h2>
<p>Ask any photographer what the most important component of photography is and she will undoubtedly answer, “Light!” It is no different when capturing fall color and is arguably especially so. You need ideal light to capture the colors and textures of the trees during this magical time. Having a firm understanding of how to use light can ensure that the hues you see in front of your camera are just as rich and vibrant in your photographs.</p>
<p>One of my favorite times to photograph fall foliage is during golden hour or ‘magic’ hour. This is the hour after the sun rises or before the sun falls. During this time the angle and color of the light is universally flattering.</p>

			<p>By contrast, cloudy days can provide an equally desirable light source to use as they bring out those rich tones and hues that aren’t always visible under the sun. And here’s a secret: while many people do not favor flat light, it is my absolute favorite for capturing fall colors!</p>
<p>Without having to contend with harsh highlights, I am able to capture the saturated colors of fall foliage and retain every last detail of those leaves. Even more, overcast days allow leaves to retain their natural moisture. This results in more vibrant colors than those leaves that the sun has dried.</p>

<p>In the fall, golden hour light becomes especially warm, rich, and golden. Almost orange, this light can further enhance the autumn landscape. The angle of the light is lower than it is in the summer. This more directional light provides increased depth.</p>

			<h2>Color Play</h2>
<p>After you have searched for and scouted the perfect fall foliage scene, consider how you are going to use and capture that magnificent color. Personally, I love to photograph my son amongst the fall foliage.</p>
<p>Before setting-out, I try to have an idea of the colors of the leaves where we will be going. If there are a lot of warm yellows, reds, and oranges in the leaves I will dress him in cooler or more neutral tones. If there are more greens, grays, or undersaturated colors, then I will dress my subject in warmer tones to compliment the scene. By choosing clothing and accessories that compliment the colors of the leaves, you add balance to the scene and allow your subject to stand out from the background.</p>

			<h2>Use the weather</h2>
<p>Fall happens in such a short window. It seems that the temperatures can change from sweltering summer heat to wintry cold in an instant. The weather can be unstable with rain, fog, wind and even frost…and all in the same day!</p>
<p>Don’t let the elements stop you from exploring outside during this time. In fact, the elements ca  add another layer of authenticity, texture, or mystery to your photography that should be welcomed.</p>
<p>My absolute favorite time during the fall is when you have those cool nights and wake up to a thick layer of mist and fog. Fog can soften and mute colors, add mood, atmosphere and beautiful compositions. I don’t hesitate to wake up my son a little earlier than normal and we run outside with the dogs before breakfast to go exploring.</p>

			<p>Fall is a wonderful opportunity for photographers of all genres to be inspired and create photo magic. Look at subjects that you shoot often with a new eye. Photograph them up-close, down low, in different weather and light. You will open your eyes to new scenes and will be sure to capture the beauty of the season.</p>

			<p>For those of us that currently live in the Northern Hemisphere, winter is on its way out and spring is right around the corner.</p>
<p>Spring can be described as having all the weather conditions and it can change in an instant &#8211; despite what the weatherman says. Being a photographer, you have no control over the weather.</p>
<p>But I say, give me all the fog, snow, rain and wind!</p>
<p>When the weather suddenly shifts, people start to take cover and I love to shoot in what you call real weather because that&#8217;s when you get the dramatic skies and the sudden shaft of sunlight as the clouds part way.</p>
<p>This gives me the opportunity to create emotion and to capture textures and dimension in an otherwise ordinary scene.</p>
<h2>Protect your gear</h2>
<p>First and foremost, before you grab your camera and go running into a thunderstorm, you need to protect your gear. A great way to do this is with a rain guard.</p>
<p>You also need to pick a lens and stick with it &#8211; don&#8217;t try to switch lenses when the sleet is coming down and could get water inside your camera.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s very cold outside, one danger that will be presented to you is condensation on the cold surfaces. Not when you are outside but when you come back inside where it&#8217;s warm. What I like to do is put my camera inside a large Ziploc freezer bag. The condensation will form on the outside of the bag and your camera will stay dry.</p>

<p>My favorite weather to photograph in, besides fog, is a <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/taking-photographs-on-an-overcast-day-tutorial-by-kristin-ingalls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gloomy overcast day</a>.</p>
<p>The clouds act as a natural light diffuser and can be ideal weather for portraits. Your subject will be evenly lit and there will be no strong contrasts, harsh light or unwanted shadows. You can go both outdoors and indoors.</p>
<p>This is the kind of light that I love to use indoors when taking a food photograph or a portrait of my son beside a window.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re outside and start to see the rain clouds start to roll in. Don’t be afraid and run inside. Instead, protect your gear and use the rain and moody clouds to your advantage.</p>
<p>I see so many opportunities to capture moments in the rain whether that be your child trying to catch rain drops on their tongue or jumping in a puddle, using your tripod and capturing a wide angle landscape shot of rain clouds to practicing your macro work and capture rolling drops of rain.</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Fog</span></h3>
<p>Fog is my absolute favorite kind of weather for photos. It adds a certain element of mystique and interest without doing much of anything.</p>
<p>Fog also helps to re-direct the light rays and spreads them evenly. This gives you wonderfully diffused light. I also love to shoot in fog because it separates the subject from the background beautifully. It adds just the right amount of magic to almost any situation!</p>

			<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Snow</span></h3>
<p>Use the same practice as you would in rain to protect your gear but also protect yourself as well.</p>
<p>I use warm fingerless mittens with a cover when shooting outside in the cold to protect my hands. Remember to always have an extra camera battery on hand as the cold drains batteries faster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/inspiration-for-shooting-in-the-snow-by-amy-lucy-lockheart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snow photos</a> can be very tricky from a technical standpoint. The surface is reflective and can distort color. I tend to underexpose just a tiny bit so that I do not lose detail in the snow. It&#8217;s very easy to over expose highlights and I tend to photograph snow when it&#8217;s overcast outside or during golden hour.</p>

			<p>The best way to feel comfortable in any weather condition with your photography is to just get out and practice. Spring can give us a lot of uncertainty with the weather and if the predictions were not accurate and you find yourself outside unsure of what to expect, you&#8217;ll be prepared!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a photographer, one of the challenges that I often face is finding balance between making emotive authentic images and perfectly posed and smiling images, especially with children.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re photographing your own kids or others during a session, here are five games I&#8217;ve picked up which can make for a more enjoyable experience for all.</p>
<h2>Imaginative word play games</h2>
<p>I love this game for older kids. An example of a word play game is for you to say a word and then you have the child say the first thing that flashes into their head.</p>
<p>You might say, “tickle” while the child might reply, “laugh.”</p>
<p>Another example would be for you to say “pool.” And she says, “splash.”</p>
<p>This is a really fun game when you bring mom and dad in on the fun, too!</p>

<h2>Tongue twisters</h2>
<p>The whole family can get in on the fun with tongue twisters. It opens up dialogue and takes the edge off everyone at the beginning of a session. Some examples to recite are:</p>
<ul>
<li>She sells sea shells by the sea shore</li>
<li>Sister Sarah shines her silver shoes for Sunday</li>
<li>A big black bug bit a big black bear</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bring prizes</h2>
<p>Bring prizes for the winners of the games played. It can be as simple as a lollipop or a roll of stickers, tearing off a few to the winner.</p>
<p>Prizes also make great incentives for the kids. There are no rules that say you can’t use bribery!</p>

<h2>Scavenger hunt</h2>
<p>Create a list of items that the children can find in their home or on location. Siblings can do the activity together as you name out the items on the list.</p>
<p>Stand back at a distance and follow them as they search for the item, allowing you to capture natural joyful interactions between siblings.</p>

<h2>Play music</h2>
<p>I find that playing music, especially for little ones, brings out many smiles and their wiggles. I usually have a playlist on my phone of child must-haves and will ask the parents if there is a favorite.</p>
<p>The parents and myself will start to dance in order to entice the little ones to join us. Currently, my favorite song to break out is the theme song to Zootopia!</p>

<p>By the time you&#8217;re done, most children do not want to stop playing the games since they&#8217;re having a fun time and did not even realize that photos were being taken of them.</p>
