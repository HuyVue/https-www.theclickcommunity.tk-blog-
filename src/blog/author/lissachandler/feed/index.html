			<p>The first few months of a new year are such a rush!</p>
<p>A new year is a new slate &#8211; a clean slate! &#8211; and, because of this, it&#8217;s easy to overwhelm ourselves with all the things we&#8217;re going to do this year to make our lives easier and skinnier and more fulfilling and more organized and more creative, too.</p>
<p>We want a new year to be the most amazing year ever &#8211; who doesn&#8217;t?! &#8211; and, honestly, the pressure we put on ourselves can be pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>But! At the same time, a clean slate is a clean slate and, when offered a clean slate at the start of the year, so many possibilities are opened before us.</p>
<p>And as photographers? There are <strong>so</strong> many ways for all of us to improve our art.</p>
<p>Photography is this magical puzzle box of learning &#8211; when one element of photography is learned, another element is uncovered (or rediscovered!) and, no matter how much you learn and no matter how strong of a photographer you are, there is always an incredible amount left to learn. It&#8217;s fascinating! I love this about photography!</p>

			<p>So! Today! I thought it would be fun to list out five ways that each of us can be a better photographer this year (or even this month!).</p>
<p>This list will work for everyone &#8211; whether you&#8217;re a master photographer who has thirty years of experience or a new photographer who purchased your first camera thirty minutes ago &#8211; we all have so much to learn about so many facets of photography and, this year, I 100% believe that all of us can make our photographs even more incredible than they are right now.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<h2>1. Pick a goal to focus on</h2>
<p>Learning photography can be overwhelming and, because of this, I believe it&#8217;s important to focus on one aspect of photography at a time. I love light in photographs and, this year, my focus is to use light more creatively &#8211; and effectively! &#8211; in my photographs.</p>
<p>And for me? This is an awesome focus that is, strangely, also somewhat relaxing. I love looking for light and, because of this, I look for light constantly &#8211; even when I don&#8217;t have a camera in hand.</p>
<p>However, if I were focusing on three different things, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do this. Instead, I&#8217;d feel overwhelmed and a little cranky because, while it&#8217;s fun and illuminating to look for light, I would burn out on my goal real quick if I were trying to give full attention to several different things at the same time.</p>
<p>And the best part? When you feel like you&#8217;ve reached your goal, you can move onto the next goal. If you&#8217;re struggling with composition, study composition &#8211; and <em>only</em> composition &#8211; for a few months. The rewards will be outstanding and you will learn so much by keeping your eyes open for one specific thing.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas of goals, with links, to focus on!</p>

			<h2>2. Ask for feedback on your photos</h2>
<p>Asking for feedback on our work can be really hard! Photography is so personal and we all put so much effort, thought, and care into our images and, because of this, it can be pretty terrifying to ask someone to tell us their honest opinion.</p>
<p>Our photographs are like our babies! But! Even though it&#8217;s hard, hearing feedback on your work is going to do two very important things: It&#8217;s going to tell you what you need to work on and it&#8217;s also going to tell you what you are doing well.</p>
<p>And even better? You can pick and choose the advice that you follow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to listen to &#8211; and truly digest! &#8211; every bit of critique you are given and, once that critique has sunk in, looking at your work objectively will do amazing things for your photographs, even if you disagree with the feedback.</p>
<p>Asking for feedback is so beneficial to every photographer and every stage. It is invaluable with photography work and I know that, in the past, I have made huge, positive changes to my work after receiving critique from a photographer I respected.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be shy when asking for critique! It is hard to hear someone else discuss your work but it is so worth &#8211; <em>so</em> worth it.</p>

			<h2>3. Be open to new possibilities</h2>
<p>When I first started my photography business, I swore up and down that I would never photograph weddings. I had a million excuses for this but, deep down, the main reason that I didn&#8217;t want to photograph weddings was because I was terrified of them.</p>
<p>Yes! I knew that they were pretty and emotional and, in theory, totally up my alley but, whenever I thought of shooting a wedding, I felt a sheer amount of horror &#8211; a feeling that makes me laugh now. I was scared of ruining wedding images, of course, but I was also scared that I would fall headfirst in love with wedding photography (which wasn&#8217;t in my plans at all!).</p>
<p>And when I first started photographing weddings? They were so hard that, afterwards, I&#8217;d come home and cry &#8211; they were so exhausting and it was so hard for me to be extremely outgoing for an entire day and, at the end of the day, I was really just happy to make it home in one piece.</p>
<p>But! Despite this! Every time I photographed a wedding, I fell more and more in love with them and, by my third wedding, I knew that weddings were the perfect fit for me.</p>
<p>Knowing this did not turn me into a spectacular, magical unicorn of a wedding photographer overnight (I wish!). Rather, I felt myself opening more and more to the possibility of pursuing a wedding photography career &#8211; something I had been terrified of! &#8211; and this changed not just my career but my entire life.</p>
<p>If I hadn&#8217;t been open to a new possibility, though, my life would be totally different!</p>

			<h2>4. Embrace change</h2>
<p>Photography is an art form and, because of this, change is inevitable both in outward trends and inwardly within yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes this change is slow and other times it hits you straight on out of nowhere but, regardless of how it comes to you, change is going to happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes this shift is very gradual &#8211; maybe we no longer love a genre like we used to or maybe we get a little bold with the contrast slider while editing in Lightroom &#8211; but, rather than fight change, I believe in embracing change and seeing where it will take you.</p>
<p>All of us go through different stages in our individual photography journeys and, because it&#8217;s a journey, there are endless possibilities! Every twist and turn will teach us so much about photography (and about ourselves!) so don&#8217;t be afraid of change if you notice that your approach to photography begins to change. Embrace the change instead!</p>

			<h2>5. Stay true to your own unique vision</h2>
<p>As photographers, each and every one of us have our own unique vision.</p>
<p>If you like bold color, edit with bold color. If you like your photographs to be super airy, make them super airy! If you love chaos in your photographs, embrace that chaos! If you are a rule breaker, learn the rules and then break them as soon as you&#8217;ve absorbed them. If you are a rule follower, follow the rules!</p>
<p>Photography is so fluid and, over the course of our photography careers &#8211; whether we are hobbyists or part time photographers or full time photographers &#8211; so much is going to change and ebb and flow. There&#8217;s so much diversity out there!</p>
<p>When you stay true to your own unique vision, the heart of your work is always going to be the same because it&#8217;s just that &#8211; <strong>your heart</strong>. When you strive to become a stronger photographer and focus on your goals to become the best photographer you can possibly (currently!) be, the heart of your photographs will show with increasing intensity.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to share yourself with the world through your photographs! The better of a photographer you are, the better you will become at conveying the heart of your images and, best of all, you are the only one out there with your own unique vision. I love this concept!</p>

			<p>I love color.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love color in my home and in my wardrobe and in artwork and I love it every single time I look up at the sky to see the sunset.</p>
<p>I LOVE color. Love it.</p>
<p>So! It should come as no surprise to anyone that my photographs are full of color. It&#8217;s not about specific colors &#8211; I love reds and greens and blues and purples all the same &#8211; it&#8217;s just that I want my photographs to pop in a way that makes you stop and, well, see the color.</p>
<p>I love colors because I feel like it represents so much of life and I also love colors because it can capture emotion so acutely and make you feel like you are standing right inside of a photograph. Today, I thought it would be fun to share with y&#8217;all the best ways to achieve bright pops of color in your photographs.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re about to see some editing videos but, before we get there, here are four things to keep in mind when you are trying to create vibrant colors in your photographs!</p>
<ol>
<li>The Contrast Slider is your friend.</li>
<li>The Vibrancy Slider is your friend.</li>
<li>Balancing the contrast and vibrancy in your photographs is CRUCIAL. To balance contrast, you will often have to bring down highlights and shadows in both the Basic Panel and the Tone Curve Panel in Lightroom. If your photographs are overpowered by a particular color &#8211; this happens all the time with greens &#8211; you&#8217;ll want to desaturate that color in the HSL Panel. This sounds scary but I promise it is super easy.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid of vignettes! I use vignettes on all of my photographs and absolutely love the way they close off a photograph. For me, vignettes are like the icing on an outfit. Your dress may be super cute in and of itself but, when you add in a bit of sparkly earrings, it&#8217;s going to shine even brighter. It&#8217;s not necessary, exactly, but it sure is pretty.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are those editing videos! I hope these are helpful to y&#8217;all to create vibrant colors in photographs. And also! I&#8217;m totally not apologizing for how many times I say &#8220;Um&#8221; in these videos &#8211; or how fast I talk or how much I laugh. Creating color in images is so much fun! Can&#8217;t wait to share these with you!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The first time I used a Canon 35L, I felt like I had stumbled onto some kind of magic wizard sorcery.</p>
<p>The lens just got me!</p>
<p>I loved the focal length and I loved the bokeh and I loved the wide aperture and, honestly, I couldn't have loved it more even if it had been painted pink and covered in glitter (and I really like the color pink and glitter, too). I know that this sounds a little fangirl-ish but, out of all of the lenses I had ever used, none of them had ever spoken to me the way the 35L did. It just felt right when I looked through the viewfinder and, when I fell in love with that lens, I fell hard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I used a <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_35mm_f_1_4l_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Canon 35L</span></a>, I felt like I had stumbled onto some kind of magic wizard sorcery.</p>
<p>The lens just got me!</p>
<p>I loved the focal length and I loved the bokeh and I loved the wide aperture and, honestly, I couldn&#8217;t have loved it more even if it had been painted pink and covered in glitter (and I really like the color pink and glitter, too).</p>
<p>I know that this sounds a little fangirl-ish but, out of all of the lenses I had ever used, none of them had ever spoken to me the way the 35L did. It just felt right when I looked through the viewfinder and, when I fell in love with that lens, I fell hard.</p>
<p>At the time, I had been photographing portraits and weddings professionally for six months and, because I&#8217;d only been shooting for six months, I was very, very green. Because I was green, I often looked to websites for lens advice (I was not yet a member of <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Clickin Moms</span></a>) and, in these websites, I&#8217;d often see that the 35L was discouraged. For portraits and wedding work, I often saw the <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_50mm_f_1_2l_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">50L</span></a>, <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_85mm_f_1_2l_ii_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">85L</span></a>, and <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_70_200mm_f_2_8l_is_ii_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">70-200 2.8L</span></a> recommended and, as time went by, I rented or bought every single one of these lenses. But! No matter how hard I tried, none of the lenses felt right to me &#8211; even if I loved them (my 85L is easily my second favorite lens), I didn&#8217;t feel connected with them in the same way I felt connected to the 35L and, after shooting with my 35L daily for over three years, I can now honestly say that I do not see the world through a traditional portrait lens &#8211; I see it like a 35L instead.</p>
<p>So! Today! I thought it would be fun to talk about non-portrait lenses and how they can be used for portrait work. There are so many awesome lenses out there and while I definitely recommend traditional portrait lenses &#8211; particularly the 50L, 85L, and <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_135mm_f_2l_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">135L</span></a> &#8211; I also think that there is absolutely no reason that a nontraditional portrait lens should sit in your bag during your photo sessions. Using non-traditional portrait lenses for portrait work is fun and exciting and challenging and I am so excited to talk about this with y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>Below are three photographs taken with three different lenses: the 35 1.4L, the <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_100mm_f_2_8l_macro_is_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">100 2.8L macro</span></a>, and the <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ts_e_45mm_f_2_8" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">45 2.8 Tilt Shift</span></a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another set! As in the photograph above, the 35L is on the left, the 100L is in the center, and the 45 Tilt Shift is on the right.</p>

<p>When photographing portraits with nontraditional portrait lenses, it is super important to keep these three things in mind.</p>
<h2>1. Be deliberate</h2>
<p>Portrait work with non-traditional portrait lenses needs to be deliberate. Sometimes this is obvious because, if you are photographing a portrait with a Tilt Shift lens, you&#8217;re naturally going to have to stop and slow down so that you can manually focus your lens. If you&#8217;re photographing someone with a wide angle lens &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a true wide angle like the <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_24mm_f_1_4l_ii_usm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">24L</span></a> or a more modest, barely wide angle lens like the 35L &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to think about distortion. All lenses have quirks and, when you&#8217;re creating portraits, you need to be aware of the quirks your lens has.</p>
<h2>2. Don&#8217;t be afraid to try new things!</h2>
<p>Is a 35L the most flattering focal length? Absolutely not. But! If I didn&#8217;t use the 35L so frequently that the focal length was, in fact, the way that I saw photographs in my head, I never would have started to try new things. While using the 35L, I started shooting through things because, with the focal length, it was <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/photography-with-depth-including-foreground-by-lissa-chandler/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">easy to place things in front of my lens</span></a>. If I had only been shooting with an 85L, this technique would not have been as easy for me to explore. It would have been possible, of course, but because of the mechanics of the 35L, it was much easier for me to learn such an exploratory technique than it would have been otherwise. If you&#8217;re shooting with a 100L, a lens specifically made for macro work, it would make perfect sense to add detail shots into your galleries. Not only would this add volume and depth to your gallery, but it&#8217;s also just a really fun way to mix up a portrait session.</p>
<h2>3. Your photographs are YOUR vision.</h2>
<p>I used to be very self conscious that I preferred the 35L to the 50L and the 85L. While I own a slew of lenses and use most of them frequently, my vision matches best with the 35L. If needed, I could photograph an entire wedding or session with just a camera body and a 35L. I love that lens! If you love a lens, even if it&#8217;s a lens that isn&#8217;t popular with your friends or the photographers you admire, embrace this! Just because other people prefer other lenses, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to prefer those lenses, too. Photography is so unique to every individual and, along with shooting and editing, photography gear is totally a personal choice. If you love a lens, don&#8217;t let it go! If you&#8217;d rather shoot an engagement session with a 24L rather than a 50L, go for it! No one is holding you back but you.</p>

<p><em>Here&#8217;s a few tips on shooting withe the 35L, the 45mm Tilt Shift, and the 100L!</em></p>
<h3>The 35L:</h3>
<p>My favorite thing about the 35L is how close it puts me to my subjects. I am a chatterbox at my sessions and the 35L puts me in close proximity to my subjects. Shooting with this lens makes my sessions less formal and more like a coffee date talking to a new friend. When shooting with this lens, however, it is so important to remember not to get too close. While I love the distortion the 35L creates, this lens is absolutely a no-go for standalone photographs of individual adults. No one wants for their face to be deformed and, with a lens of a wider angle, it&#8217;s totally possible to create a distorted photograph. However, I never worry about this with couples or families because, in those cases, the distortion creates a feeling of intimacy that cannot be created otherwise.</p>

<h3>The 45 tilt shift:</h3>
<p>I love the extra drama and emotion and fun a Tilt Shift lens can add to photographs. Tilt Shift photographs are so creative! My favorite thing about Tilt Shifts is how they really just make you stop and think. When I use a Tilt Shift, I love to sit back and take a little extra time to talk to my subjects. It&#8217;s fun and is a great conversation starter (the lens moves!!) and, really, it is just such a blast. The only downside to this lens is that, when shooting at wide apertures, it is extremely easy to lose focus. The bokeh created with Tilt Shifts is so amazing and, when shooting, it&#8217;s extremely helpful to use the LiveView shooting mode on your camera. Looking at your image on an LCD screen is so helpful and makes Tilt Shift photographs much less complicated. I love Tilt Shifts!</p>

<h3>The 100L:</h3>
<p>Honestly, I think that the 100L should be regarded as a traditional portrait lens. The 100L has the most amazing bokeh and it creates truly stunning photographs in much the same fashion as the 85L and the 135L. This lens is my husband&#8217;s favorite lens and, when I use it, I am constantly impressed by how buttery the bokeh is and how easy it is to get images in focus. The best thing about the 100L, to me, is that it is a dual purpose lens. Who wouldn&#8217;t want that in their camera bag?!</p>

<p>There are so many ways to create portraits. If you love a lens, use it! If you don&#8217;t love a lens, don&#8217;t feel tied down by it! Your vision is your vision and your gear can totally help you capture what you want to convey. Don&#8217;t be afraid to step away from tradition and try something new! The results will be fantastic!</p>

			<p>I still remember the first time that I realized I could pick my own focal point.</p>
<p>Lying on my bed late at night, my six month old snuggled up against me as I browsed photography blogs, I came across a blog post that showed two photographs taken a breath apart. The first photograph was focused on a couple; the second photograph was focused on the grass in front of the couple.</p>
<p>I thought this was magic! &#8220;How did the photographer do that?!&#8221; I thought to myself. I studied those two photographs for fifteen minutes and, showing my complete naiveté to all things photography, I decided that the photographer must have had an awesome, magical, mind-reading camera. I knew that the photographer had to have done something in-between the photographs, but I couldn&#8217;t think of what it was, so I shut the tab and continued on my late night photography browsing spree.</p>
<p>As the weeks went on, I kept thinking back to those photographs. I knew that I was missing something about focus but I couldn&#8217;t pinpoint what it was. I am completely self taught and, because of this, I didn&#8217;t even know that focal points existed. Even worse, I did not belong to any photography forums and, without the correct terminology, I couldn&#8217;t even find anything on Google to help me in my dilemma. Eventually, I realized that the answer to my question was in my camera manual and, when I figured out how to select a focal point, my whole world changed. I couldn&#8217;t believe how many doors focal points opened for me!</p>
<p>Then a funny thing happened. Several months after I taught myself how to focus, I realized that my photographs weren&#8217;t really that sharp. It&#8217;s not that my photographs were out of focus, exactly, but they weren&#8217;t quite in focus, either. They were soft and not well thought out. The softness made my photographs feel amateurish and, looking at my photographs next to photographs taken by experienced photographers, I often felt flustered and like I would never be able to master focus. Part of me wanted to give up or, at the very least ditch wide open apertures and start shooting at safe apertures but, honestly, I&#8217;ve never been a play it safe kind of girl.</p>
<p>So! Determined to learn <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/sharp-images-with-extremely-shallow-depth-of-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to nail focus at f/1.4</a> at a second&#8217;s notice, I started photographing everything. I photographed books. I photographed my one year old. I photographed flowers. I photographed furniture. I photographed shoes. I photographed skies. I photographed rings. I photographed people. I photographed my husband sleeping. I photographed my clothes. I photographed chocolate chip cookies. I photographed popcorn and lace and clovers in spring grass.</p>
<p>And finally! After tons of practice, I learned how to master focus. And while learning to master focus? I learned lots of ways to miss focus, too. So! Today! I thought it would be fun to share the three common habits that lead photographers (including me!) to miss focus.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-39966" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/get-in-focus-pictures-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x411.jpg" alt="get in focus pictures by Lissa Chandler" width="840" height="411" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/get-in-focus-pictures-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x411.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/get-in-focus-pictures-by-Lissa-Chandler-420x205.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/get-in-focus-pictures-by-Lissa-Chandler-700x342.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/get-in-focus-pictures-by-Lissa-Chandler.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>1. We don&#8217;t pay enough attention.</h2>
<p>When I do not pay enough attention to what I am photographing, the first thing I mess up is focus. While I&#8217;m sure different photographers drop the ball in different ways, focus is the first thing that goes out the window for me. When learning photography, we worry so much about correct exposure &#8211; apertures and shutter speed and ISO &#8211; that focus can fall by the wayside. We want our images to come out balanced, <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/three-steps-to-perfect-exposure-every-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not too dark or too light</a> or too blurry or too grainy and, because of this, it&#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in exposure rather than focus. But! To make amazing photographs, we need to pay attention to both!</p>
<p>Another way that we don&#8217;t pay enough attention? We distract ourselves. Maybe we&#8217;re focused on making our clients comfortable or we&#8217;re focused on getting the shot as quickly as we can or maybe we&#8217;re just feeling really self conscious or maybe we just fumble because we&#8217;re thinking about a to-do list waiting for us on the counter. Whatever it is, if we&#8217;re not focused on achieving sharp images, we&#8217;re not going to achieve sharp images. Sharp images don&#8217;t happen unless we make them happen and, if we do not pay attention, we&#8217;ll miss focus if we are not deliberate about where our focal points fall in the frame.</p>

<h2>2. We try to go too fast.</h2>
<p>This is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome when learning focus. If I slip focus on a photograph, I can almost always look at that photograph and realize that I was going a mile a second and not taking the time to breathe between shots. Mastering focus takes time &#8211; especially when shooting at wide apertures, we need to be very conscious of where our focal points fall. If we do not pay attention and get wrapped up in a flurry of making things happen as quickly as possibly, the caliber of your focus will go down. This is true for all apertures but, again, shooting at wide apertures takes time and, even when you&#8217;ve shot wide open for years, it takes concentration to select the correct focal point.</p>

<h2>3. We don&#8217;t practice enough.<b><br />
</b></h2>
<p>Learning correct focus took me over a year. At the time of learning focus, though, I thought I had learned everything about focus in just a few weeks. Because of this, I felt cocky about my work &#8211; I had learned something new and, super proud of my new skill set, I often overlooked when my photographs were soft or just kind of pushed it aside if I realized that I slightly slipped focus. After several months of this, I realized that I needed to buck up and learn more. To practice focus, I would sometimes shoot one object at several different apertures and, afterwards, look at the photographs to see what I liked best. After doing this, I learned to slow down and really, truly focus on my subjects &#8211; whether that was the face of a person I had just met or a flower sitting on my kitchen table. Doing this made me appreciate my subjects more and, coincidentally, the more I slowed down, the easier I found it to nail focus if I needed to quickly. Don&#8217;t forget to practice like crazy even when you think you&#8217;ve got it all figured out.</p>

<h3>And Bonus! Learning composition helped my photography immensely.</h3>
<p>Learning composition helped my photography in more ways than I could ever possibly list. And best of all? Experimenting with new compositions really helped me with focus. When I tried out a new composition &#8211; whether it was a close composition or a wide composition or weak composition or a strong composition &#8211; I didn&#8217;t feel complacent. I felt excited because I no longer felt like I was shooting the same thing over and over. Since I didn&#8217;t feel complacent and because being creative made me even more passionate about photography than I had ever felt before, I paid more attention to my photographs and, by extension, paid more attention to my focal points. Everything about focusing had to be more deliberate &#8211; if I was using a camera with only a strong center point, I had to <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/focus-and-recompose-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus and recompose</a> and, if I was using a camera with lots of strong focal points, I had to carefully select a focal point so that the part of the frame I wanted to be in focus would be in focus. And over time? This helped me learn focus better than anything else ever could have.</p>
<p>So! Get out there and practice focus! If you are not sure how to select your focal point, consult your camera manual and, as soon as you have read the basics, just start shooting. Selecting your own focal point will help you take total control over your photographs and your artistic vision and, years after mastering focus, I am still totally in awe of the fact that a simple shift in focus can change the entire feeling of a photograph.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not selecting your focal points already, make the switch! You will LOVE it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Twenty-Two Year Old, Wanna-Be Photographer Me,</p>
<p>You&#8217;re cute. Like, really cute.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38097" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boy-playing-on-the-porch-photograph-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg" alt="boy playing on the porch photograph by Lissa Chandler" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boy-playing-on-the-porch-photograph-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boy-playing-on-the-porch-photograph-by-Lissa-Chandler-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boy-playing-on-the-porch-photograph-by-Lissa-Chandler-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boy-playing-on-the-porch-photograph-by-Lissa-Chandler.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I am kind of jealous of how cute you are. Right now, five years ago to this day, you have been married for two months and five days and, this very week, your husband has bought you your very first DSLR, a Canon 40d with a 50 f/1.8 and a zoom lens you found used on Amazon for $110. You&#8217;re not sure what a 50 1.8 lens is exactly, but you are going to be dancing a happy dance around your apartment for the next three months because that camera is going to put you over the moon with happiness. You think that refurbished camera is the best thing that has ever happened to anyone.</p>
<p>Right now, you are giddy. You are happy and you are excited and you are so confident that it seeps out of every pore of your body, every step that you take, and every time you bounce your hair. You&#8217;re a photographer! You don&#8217;t know yet that your camera can come off the &#8220;P&#8221; setting &#8211; you&#8217;re going to think that you broke it when you switch it to &#8220;M&#8221; and every image the camera takes comes out black &#8211; and you are going to blush really hard when you say you love photography and people say words like &#8220;aperture&#8221; and &#8220;shutter speed&#8221; but, ultimately, you&#8217;re going to just smile and say that you don&#8217;t really need to learn the technical stuff. You&#8217;re an artist!</p>
<p>At least&#8230; you think you&#8217;re an artist.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38100" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dad-holding-son-picture-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg" alt="dad holding son picture by Lissa Chandler" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dad-holding-son-picture-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dad-holding-son-picture-by-Lissa-Chandler-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dad-holding-son-picture-by-Lissa-Chandler-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dad-holding-son-picture-by-Lissa-Chandler.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>And my friend? You are so, so wrong. You will be! You really will be! But, before you become one, you have so much to learn. See, since we are the same person and I have a whoppin&#8217; five years on you, I can say with absolute sincerity that I know exactly what you feel every time you pick up that camera. Your hands shake a little bit and your heart races a little faster and you feel so happy every single time you pick up that black box. You&#8217;ve felt that way your entire life &#8211; from the first time your mom let you use your allowance to buy a disposable camera to the time you touched your very first film SLR in high school to the time that your friend Sean let you keep his digital camera for an entire semester your freshman year of college to the time that you received the 5d Mark III in the mail &#8211; you feel the same way every time. For you, holding a camera lights a huge spark inside of you. It&#8217;s always been that way for you.</p>
<p>When people ask you about your first memories, you talk about running around the pink house you grew up in and battling with your brothers over Legos and meeting your little sister the day she was born at the hospital, but you usually leave out the most vivid memories: the mornings and the afternoons and the late nights where your mom would let you sit on her bed and flip through the three-ring, brown binders with sticky paper holding together thousands of memories. Some of the memories you remembered yourself and some of the memories happened before you were born, but none of that really mattered &#8211; you just loved the memories. You loved those books so much and, every time you hold a camera, you feel that little lunge in your chest every single time.</p>
<p>You know all of this. You know how photography makes you feel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38098" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-crawling-through-tunnel-photo-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg" alt="child crawling through tunnel photo by Lissa Chandler" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-crawling-through-tunnel-photo-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-crawling-through-tunnel-photo-by-Lissa-Chandler-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-crawling-through-tunnel-photo-by-Lissa-Chandler-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-crawling-through-tunnel-photo-by-Lissa-Chandler.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>But! You don&#8217;t know everything and, in a year, you are about to start a crazy journey of learning and shooting and processing and learning and shooting and processing some more. Right now, you think that photography is a natural skill &#8211; that you have an eye of sorts and, because of this, you&#8217;re going to be really confused when your photographs don&#8217;t turn out how you imagine. For you, the next five years are going to be a flurry. You have some amazing years coming up for you and, while there&#8217;s a ton of things I could tell you to be better at, when it comes to photography, it boils down to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never lose that feeling that you have whenever you pick up a camera.</li>
<li>Never, ever let your confidence get away from you.</li>
</ol>
<p>You see, learning photography is going to be a lot more difficult than you imagine and, because of this and the fact that you won&#8217;t be able to learn everything overnight, you are going to be frustrated and you&#8217;re going to take a very lonely journey learning the right way to manipulate your settings and the right way to talk to your clients and the right way to be yourself while holding a camera. But! After you get through this, operating a camera is going to be second nature to you and, in all sincerity, it is going to be so, so worth it. It&#8217;s going to be crazy and there are going to be times that you look at your husband and say &#8220;I give up!&#8221; when you don&#8217;t understand something but I am here to tell you that perseverance is so worth it and that today, you&#8217;d go through the same thing five times in a row just to learn everything you have learned (and, today, I still have SO much to learn it&#8217;s mind boggling!).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-38099" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-sleeping-pic-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg" alt="child sleeping pic by Lissa Chandler" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-sleeping-pic-by-Lissa-Chandler-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-sleeping-pic-by-Lissa-Chandler-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-sleeping-pic-by-Lissa-Chandler-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/child-sleeping-pic-by-Lissa-Chandler.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>So! Just hold on to that feeling of love and excitement and nostalgia and happiness every time you think of photographs. Hold onto that feeling and you will do amazing things.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Your Twenty-Seven Year Old, Knows-How-to-Work-a-Camera Self</p>

			<p>Flower Crowns!</p>
<p>They are kind of wonderful, right?</p>
<div style="display: none;">
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55768" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown.jpg" alt="I love incorporating trends into my photographs and, right now, I am loving this trend." width="736" height="1282" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown.jpg 736w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown-241x420.jpg 241w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown-482x840.jpg 482w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown-200x348.jpg 200w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown-400x697.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DIY-how-to-make-a-flower-crown-600x1045.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
</div>
<p>I love incorporating trends into my photographs and, right now, I am loving this trend. I often tell my husband that I think of flower crowns like I think of Marie Antoinette&#8217;s hair- they just get bigger and bigger and, eventually, they are going to die out. But! Right now! They are all over the place and I am loving every second of their time in the spotlight.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2QQ6GbnJMI4?list=UUCFAL41SVzH-xD3vdhydyWw" width="840" height="473" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>So! Let&#8217;s recap!</p>
<p>To make a flower crown you need four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Floral Wire</li>
<li>Floral Tape</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Flowers</li>
</ol>
<p>This does not need to be an expensive prop. The flower crown y&#8217;all just watched me make cost fifteen dollars. In the world of photography props, this is just a drip in a bucket. Plus, they are so fun! And colorful!</p>
<p>Making your flower crown is simple. As pictured above, simply make a circle with your floral wire, cut off your flower of choice (leave at least one inch of stem on your flower), and start taping&#8230; then tape some more. You&#8217;ll be taping for a while and, as mentioned in the video, you will want to change the directions of the flower. The first crown you make will be difficult but, once you have finished the first one, this project will become super easy. I made my first one of these in April 2013 and can now make them in my sleep. It just takes a little practice!</p>

<p>While some of these crowns are simple, some are absolutely wild- it all depends on what you want! I like making large, crazy crowns because they are over-the-top, fun, and, if I&#8217;m being totally honest, also hide flaws easily. But! It is very possible to make extremely simple, soft flower crowns by using this exact same process.</p>
<p>So! What are you waiting for?! Go out and make a flower crown for a shoot! And when you&#8217;re done? Post those photos on the forum!</p>
<p>P.S. A big shout-out to my husband for making this video! You are the best!</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">My Favorite Setup, Canon 5d Mark III and 35L:  Before we get started with my crazy list of lenses, I had to give a little shoutout to my Mark III and 35L.</p>
<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">The Mark III is, hands down, my camera soul-mate &#8211; something about the colors, the focal points, the depth of the photographs, and the way it felt in my hands made me fall completely in love the first I used this camera. I shot with a Mark II from January 2012 to September 2013 and, while I loved that camera, it always felt like there was something missing. Basically, the Mark II is an awesome camera, but the Mark III is a heart stopper. I love it! Aside from the Mark III and Mark II, I also own a Canon 6d but I do not use it frequently.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">Canon 24L tilt-shift, The Game Changer:  The Canon 24L Tilt Shift was the first lens to really rock my world. When I pulled it out of the box, I was flabbergasted and could not figure it how to use it. But! Despite this! I LOVED it and, after a few months, we finally fell in synch with each other. I have an old version of this lens- I believe mine was made in the early nineties- but there is a new version available.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">Canon 35L, The Way I See the World: Remember how the Mark III is my camera soulmate? The 35L is my lens soulmate. I use it for everything- seniors, engagements, weddings, everyday life, anytime I&#8217;m indoors- I just absolutely love it. I recommend this lens to everyone.</p>

<p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">Canon 45 tilt-shift, The New Lens:  Canon&#8217;s 45mm Tilt Shift is my newest lens. I&#8217;ve only had it for a few weeks but am over the moon happy with this lens. I have been pleasantly surprised with how different the bokeh from the 45mm is compared to the 24mm Tilt Shift and I absolutely love how easy the 45mm is to use. Also, the focal length can&#8217;t be beat.</p>

I love the 50mm focal length and do sometimes get frustrated with this lens- my copy is good but not super reliable. But! I haven&#8217;t upgraded it yet because I am nervous to do so. There&#8217;s lots of opinions out there about the 50L!</p>

So! I run my entire business out of a corner desk in our living room. We definitely do not have a ton of space but my little corner is just what I need right now. I can&#8217;t wait for a large office in the future, though! In the photographs above, you&#8217;ll see an <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/" target="_blank">iMac</a> and also a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a> set on top of my printer. I cull my weddings and write most of my blog posts on my laptop. But! As much as I love my laptop, I only edit on my iMac. I am a very simple, very picky editor and, because of this, I really enjoy seeing my images large while I work on them.</p>

<ol>
<li>I am a huge book nerd and can tell you everything there ever was to know about Harry Potter- including the little breadcrumbs left by JK Rowling after the series was finished.</li>
<li>In college, I took advanced classes to become a picture book author.</li>
<li>I am naturally shy but, in high school and college, trained myself to be more outgoing. This means that I am both super quiet and very talkative, depending on the setting.</li>
<li>I married my husband five months and two days after the first time we spoke and it was, hands down, the best decision I ever made.</li>
<li>My name- Lissa- is a nickname. My full name is Elisabeth.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know about y&#8217;all, but I love a good pullback.</p>
<p>I mean, let&#8217;s be honest, they are pretty magical.</p>
<p>There is something so awe inspiring, breathtaking even, about a wide angle shot of a location and, immediately after, seeing several photographs nestled underneath it taken in the exact same spot at nearly the exact same time.</p>
<p>I find pullbacks to be incredibly inspiring and, today, when I sat down to write this post, I had every intention of sharing traditional pullbacks with y&#8217;all.</p>
<p>Something happened as I looked at my pullback shots, though. As much as I love those wide angle shots, I like them more with people in them.</p>
<p><strong>So today, we are going to talk about pullbacks with a twist.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of sharing a wide angle landscape photograph and following it up with a few portraits, I am going to show y&#8217;all one wide angle, environmental portrait and then share two close ups taken in the same environment.</p>
<h2>First up, a photo series of my son!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32182 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The above photograph is a wide angle shot of my one year old, Henry, hanging out on my bed. Henry loves spending long afternoons rolling around my bed with books and toys and, best of all, pillows (he&#8217;s a snuggler).</p>
<p>So, being a mom who loves to photograph her babies, I set out to document him relaxing one afternoon. The shot above shows Henry at the edge of the bed. There&#8217;s a window on the left side of the frame, a cradle full of (folded!) laundry next to the window, and a mess of pillows against my yellow headboard.</p>
<p>I love the window light in this room and, apparently, Henry does, too.</p>
<p>Here he is laying in the sunlight:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32183 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As he laid there, he kept pulling on his feet and laughing so, as I laid down on my belly next to him, I turned for a moment and took a photograph of his feet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32184 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-One-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>These three photographs were all taken within five minutes of each other. As we took these, I was talking to him and we were playing with stuffed animals and laughing.</p>
<p>The light and our environment never changed &#8211; there was a huge stack of laundry on the left side of every single one of these photographs and a cup of water on the bookcase on the other side of the bed &#8211; but, by coming in closer to my son and noticing details, I was able to add variety to my photographs with minimal effort.</p>
<h2>Next up, the sweetest seventeen-year-old.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32188 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When I took these photographs of India, I knew that I wanted them to be fresh, fun and full of light. In the photograph above, we are standing in a tiny gravel parking lot that, honestly, is kind of a side road behind some baseball fields.</p>
<p>Over India&#8217;s right shoulder there&#8217;s a patch of amazing golden hour light. Immediately after taking the first photograph, I had India pull out some sunglasses and we took this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32189 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In this photograph, I am using the same lens I used in India&#8217;s first photograph, a Canon 35 1.4L. India is sitting in the exact same spot she is sitting in for the first photograph and my settings are basically the same as well, the only thing that has changed is my position, her pose, and her sunglasses.</p>
<p>By taking several steps forward and isolating the background of the trees and light, I have created a totally different feeling in the second photograph when compared to the first.</p>
<p>For my next photograph, I decided to switch things up a little more and swapped my 35L out for the Canon 85 1.2L. Set at 1.2, I had India stand up, remove her sunglasses, and stand at the left side of her car. I then took this photograph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32190 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Two-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Location wise, my favorite part about this third photograph is that it looks like we are smack dab in the middle of spring (and we totally weren&#8217;t!). If you look back to her first photograph, you will see that the trees behind her are mostly dead.</p>
<p>By choosing an 85mm lens, a longer focal length, and opening the lens up as wide as possible, I was able to isolate India from the background. This made the trees behind her appear more green than they actually were.</p>
<p>With the extra bonus of the golden light, India looks as if she is an entirely different location than she was in for the first two photographs. It&#8217;s amazing how that can happen, right?!</p>
<h2>Last up, a photo series of one of the cutest couples ever.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32185 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-1-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The above photograph was taken at my very favorite time of day, the time of day when the golden hour is fading and dusk is quickly approaching.</p>
<p>I placed this couple on a hill, took a few steps away from them, and shot this photograph. I absolutely love this kind of light so, without moving my couple, I walked closer to them and took this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32186 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-2-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As I took this photograph, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice how nicely the light was coming across their shoulders, so, again, I took several more steps in and shot this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-32187 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg" alt="photography pullbacks with a twits tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pullback-Three-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-3-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In these three photographs, my couple did not move a single inch. The exact same light was behind them the entire time but, by putting myself somewhere new, I was able to create diverse photographs.</p>
<p>And there you have it! Three simple examples of three simple pullbacks.</p>
<p>So remember, next time you take an environmental portrait of anyone &#8211; your children, a senior, a family, a couple, or even at a wedding &#8211; check your surroundings, examine the light around you, and capture your subject in a way that will make your photographs sing.</p>
<p>You can do this at any time, anywhere, and any place. You won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

<p>I always wanted to be a photographer.</p>
<p>Not just a photographer, I also wanted to be a mom and a writer and a teacher. But mostly, I wanted to be a photographer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31362 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-1.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Northwest Arkansas photographer Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-1.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-1-310x209.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, my favorite afternoon activity was to lie down on the floor on my stomach and shuffle through all of the photographs in my mom&#8217;s old photo albums and boxes. It didn&#8217;t matter who the photographs were of &#8211; my mother, my father, their parents, their siblings, my siblings, or me &#8211; I really didn&#8217;t care. Something about those photographs made my heart beat a little faster and I was absolutely fascinated that a memory, any memory, could be preserved on a small 4&#215;6 piece of paper and somehow bring it to life all over again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31364 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-3.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Northwest Arkansas photographer Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-3.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-3-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>By the time I was in junior high and old enough to carry around a purse (a strappy, skinny brown one with flowers embroidered on the side), I started carrying around a camera. I didn&#8217;t care about what kind of camera it was &#8211; disposable cameras, my mom&#8217;s camera, or my $25 hot pink, see through camera that I covered with glittering star stickers &#8211; I didn&#8217;t care as long as I had a camera. Every month, I would drop at least four or five rolls of film off at Wal-Mart and hold my breath until they came back to me. Around this time, I realized that, even though other people loved and appreciated photographs of themselves, their friends, and their families, I loved photography in a very different way; I loved it, no matter who the subject was. No matter how many photographs I took and no matter how many photographs I looked at, it wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31366 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-6.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Northwest Arkansas photographer Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-6.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-6-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In high school, my parents bought me my first entry-level SLR for Christmas one year; it was silver and shiny and, the first time I accidentally took the lens off, I was positive that I had somehow broken the camera, set it on my dresser, and didn&#8217;t touch it for another week or two. Honestly, I was terrified of it! Shortly after, I started college and enrolled as a photography major but, by the middle of my sophomore year, changed my tune and became a double major in History and English. And you guys, I LOVED studying History and English. It has been two and a half years since I graduated and I am absolutely positive that those two majors were the perfect majors for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31367 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-8.jpg" alt="the photography journey of Northwest Arkansas photographer Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-8.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Northwest-Arkansas-Photographer-Lissa-Chandler-Photography-Journey-8-310x206.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>But! They weren&#8217;t photography. I married my husband in college and, several months after our wedding, my husband pooled together all of our money and bought me a Canon 40d, a speedlite, and a 50 1.8. I set that sucker on &#8220;P&#8221;, started taking engagement photographs for two months, and then found out I was pregnant. And here is the part where my story gets a little sticky: When I became pregnant, I actually kinda loathed photography and, when I became a mom, I was 5,000% happy with solely having photographs of my kids that I had taken with a point and shoot or camera phone. I wasn&#8217;t interested in learning photography to take better photographs of my super happy, super chunky, super awesome little babe. In fact, I can remember walking past my Canon 40d one afternoon and bursting out laughing &#8211; laughing that I had ever thought that, of all things, I would be a professional photographer. I mean, who does that?</p>

<p>Anyway, after my son was born, I had pretty severe postpartum depression. When this didn&#8217;t go away after six months and nothing seemed to help me feel better, my husband nudged me to pick up an old hobby, handed me the camera he had scrimped and saved for, and sent me on my merry way. I started shooting all of my friends and family members and also started reading everything I could about photography. This started in February 2011 and, in April 2011, I graduated from college, started shooting in Manual, upgraded to a Canon 7d and an 85 1.8, booked and completed my first wedding and started a personal project called &#8220;Women Who Love&#8221;. We moved to Northwest Arkansas in July 2011 and, within two weeks, I had set up and started my business.</p>

<p>Saying that I have put in a lot of hard work and sweat and tears and all-nighters for my photography in the past two years would be a severe understatement. Since moving to Arkansas, I have shot roughly one hundred portrait sessions, nearly twenty weddings, completed a 365 project and, most importantly, had a brand new baby who just turned one. During this time I also joined Clickin Moms, joined CMPro, read countless books, and have also taken several workshops and a few breakouts. For me, photography is like breathing and it is my goal to meet and photograph as many people and capture as many memories as I possible can. I LOVE photography and am so excited to see where it takes me in the future because, really, I&#8217;m just starting.</p>

			<p>Stale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of a biting word isn&#8217;t it? To say that something is stale?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true sometimes though! Sometimes bread goes stale. Sometimes writing goes stale. Sometimes relationships go stale. And sometimes? Our photography goes stale, too.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-27866 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/framing-your-subjects-through-objects-photography-tutorial-by-Lissa-Chandler-Post-9.jpg" alt="framing your subjects through objects photography tutorial by Lissa Chandler" width="640" height="500" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/framing-your-subjects-through-objects-photography-tutorial-by-Lissa-Chandler-Post-9.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/framing-your-subjects-through-objects-photography-tutorial-by-Lissa-Chandler-Post-9-310x242.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As photographers, we look at so many images, made both by ourselves and by our peers. Sometimes we study these images for hours and other times we just see them in passing, but the image are always there. Because of this, sometimes our own photography starts to feel a little redundant and, when you&#8217;ve photographed something dozens of times &#8211; whether it&#8217;s your children playing before nap time or a bride getting ready on her wedding day &#8211; it&#8217;s easy to run out of ideas.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I started to feel this way pretty heavily. I felt like all of my photographs looked the same.</p>
<p>Then, one afternoon, I sat down to photograph my children playing on the porch and, by chance, my oldest ran inside and started playing on the other side of the glass door. I turned to take a photograph of him through the glass (which, at the time, seemed like the silliest thing to do) and I LOVED the photograph.</p>
<p>Truthfully, it was bad. It took me several more times shooting through glass to capture the moment right but that was the moment I realized that, no matter what, I would never run out of ideas because there is always something to shoot through. Always.</p>

<p>Look around yourself at a photo shoot &#8211; what is there around you to shoot through? At sessions, I always carry a few shards of glass and a prism in my bag. But! I don&#8217;t usually use them. Instead, I use elements from the session.</p>
<p>If I am shooting in a place with lots of leaves, like an overgrown fence or even a park with lots of bushes, I will position myself to shoot through the leaves. If there are flowers or leaves around me during a session, I will shoot through those, too. Sometimes, I keep things natural and shoot through actual branches and other times I pick them off the ground &#8211; or even pluck them off if there is nothing on the ground to pick up.</p>
<p>Now, think about what&#8217;s around you when you are photographing your everyday life. Have your children dumped all of their toys in their living room? Get down on your belly and photograph them through the toys; the bokeh made by the toys will be incredible.</p>
<p>Are you looking at Christmas lights with your family? Lean against the lights and photograph your family with the lights in front, the result will be dazzling. Are you taking a walk with your children? Walk a few steps ahead of them, crouch down, and photograph through the leaves of the nearest tree, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

<p>Leaves. Flowers. Glass. These things are just the start of objects you can shoot through. If you are feeling uninspired, sometimes bringing something as simple as a small strip of lace can completely change the outcome of your final photograph.</p>
<p>Look around your environment, there is always something to shoot through. And the best part? Even if you often shoot in the same location, there is always something new.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom at different times of year. Leaves change every fall. Seasonal changes bring new perspectives everywhere &#8211; why not embrace this and add an extra element to your photographs?</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2022-01-07-Blog-Banner.jpg" title="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" alt="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" /></div>
<p>For me, when I see a photograph where the photographer has obviously shot through an object, I feel a heightened sense of emotion and connection to the photograph because the images often seem so personal.</p>
<p>While this is not a technique that should be used on every photograph (it would definitely lose its effect if it was used constantly), there are so many options for framing, visual interest, and awareness when, as an artist, we bring an unexpected element into our photographs.</p>
<p>For example, here are two photographs taken within thirty seconds of one another. The left image is not a bad image. It&#8217;s pretty, a pretty photograph of a pretty girl sitting in a pretty end-of-summer woods. But! When I moved half an inch and shot through the grass and branches growing out of the ground, I was able to create the right image!</p>

			<p>The first image is pretty, but the second image is memorable.</p>
<p>As photographers, we should want to create interesting, memorable images! So! Pick up something near you today and shoot through it.  You&#8217;re going to feel (and look!) ridiculous but, in the end, the payoff is one hundred percent worth it.</p>
