<p>Even if we were to go to the same beach every day, the dance between the sun and water is truly unique to each new day. I never tire of watching them in action.</p>

			<p>There is nothing quite like a good book. I have spent so many nights staying up too late as I read “just one more chapter”.</p>
<p>Now that my son loves reading, we read a lot of the same books. It is so wonderful to be able to talk to him about the books, and to be “in the know”. We have had so many amazing conversations and discussions about book topics and different characters…and, yes, the book is ALWAYS better than the movie!</p>

			<p>I love to play and experiment with my photography. It can be so easy to fall in to routines and patterns that I could easily get bored with my work. Playing with creative lenses really allows me to express myself creatively.</p>
<p>My favorite creative lenses are my <a href="https://lensbaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lensbaby</a> lenses. I also love to bring my fisheye lens out to see the world from a new perspective.</p>

			<p>Yes. I love <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/click/subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click</a>. I have been a subscriber since the very first issue and I have saved every single copy. It is one magazine that I refer back to and am constantly inspired by.</p>
<p>Being published in Click was a dream come true for me. Even though I had already received my copy in the mail, my son and I went to our local Barnes and Noble so that we could buy another copy in person. I loved being able to connect with him through this joint project.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Nothing compares to holding a stack of images in your hand and being able to look through them. I absolutely love seeing my images in print. I definitely have my fair share of photo books, but a stack of prints is really what makes me happy.</p>
<p>I love that I always have images available to share with others and to use for school projects when they come up at the last minute. From a technical point, printing is also such a great way to check the color on my monitor. My favorite labs to use are <a href="https://www.millerslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller&#8217;s</a>, <a href="https://www.artifactuprising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artifact Uprising</a> and <a href="http://www.artsycouture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artsy Couture</a>.</p>

			<p>Editing is a bit of a passion for me. A perfect day would be to have several hours of uninterrupted time to edit.</p>
<p>One of my favorite editing techniques is to add texture to an image. I love the depth and dimension it adds to an image. I also love how it creates unexpected color and contrast in select parts of an image. Adding textures from <a href="http://jessicadrossin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Drossin</a>&#8216;s collection to my work has lifted me out of a creativity rut many times.</p>

			<p>I am obsessed with my <a href="https://www.doterra.com/US/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doTerra oils</a>. They have changed my life in so many ways. We start our days with calming oils and focus oils. I also have oils in my morning tea. Throughout the day, we use oils for clear breathing, muscle aches, and any cuts and scrapes that may come our way.</p>

			<p>The wonderful thing about a hill is that you can position yourself to capture both sunrise and sunset, and you have nothing in the background to distract from your subject.</p>
<p>We have a little, tiny hill behind our house. It isn’t much, but if I get down low enough, it makes it look higher than it actually is. We have been able to create so many different looks and scenes on this hill, and it inspires me every time.</p>

			<p>My first love has always been children’s literature.</p>
<p>As a child (long before the video age) I would spend hours immersing myself in new worlds… pouring over the beautiful illustrations in books and memorizing every last detail on the page.</p>
<p>Today, when I create an image of my own, I try to pay the same amount of attention to every last detail included in my frame as I did to those amazing illustrations and allow myself to be swept away into a new world.</p>
<p>So, how do we go from merely editing an image to creating a “storybook” piece? Let’s take a look and as I show you the steps I take in editing this image, please keep in mind that my “numbers” will not match yours exactly because the conditions under which I took my image do not match yours exactly; we have different cameras, different lenses, different locations, different light, different weather conditions, different experiences, different ideas, different visions so adjust your image to match YOUR specific conditions and YOUR unique vision.</p>
<p>Instead of following my identical numbers, it would be best to follow the “thought process” behind my adjustments, so that you can apply them to your own.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I will always straighten the image. I spend so much time playing and “undoing” in the panels that I have many times regretted saving this step for later. In this case, I straightened to the houses in the background. The palm tree was slightly askew, so I wanted to retain that effect.</p>
<p>As I survey the scene before me, I note any distracting elements that do not contribute to this story. Many of them I will remove in Lightroom but the more tedious ones I save for my Photoshop work. Here, I intentionally chose to preserve the beach houses in this scene because I felt they were a part of the “summer beach days” story.</p>
<p>After that, I go to the top of my LR panel, and work my way down.</p>
<p>In my SOOC image you will notice that it is underexposed. I often underexpose my outdoor images in order to retain some of the sky, and then pull the exposure up in LR.</p>
<p>I really liked the neutral colors in this image and wanted to maintain them. I also wanted the green to be a little more dark and bold to offset the neutral palette and guide the eye smoothly and naturally through the frame. I adjusted the white balance (tint to green) and the HSL panel for this effect. (Please note that I am usually hesitant to adjust the white balance tint to green too far, and this is much farther than I would usually go. Please watch your skin!!)</p>
<p>I adjust the clarity, vibrance, and saturation just enough to give them a slight boost for now.</p>

<p>In the HSL panel, I adjusted my greens rather significantly to give them the look I was trying to achieve. I selectively played with the hue of many colors, de-saturated them, and adjusted the luminance in order to give the image more of a washed out, almost watercolor effect that you might find in a “storybook” illustration.</p>
<p>I also give just a slight play in the tone panel to help with this effect.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-49613" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-840x377.jpg" alt="Before and After, Creating a “Storybook” Image in Lightroom and Photoshop Elements by Jan Tyler" width="840" height="377" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-840x377.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-420x189.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-330x148.jpg 330w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3-690x310.jpg 690w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-3.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>A little play in the split toning panel gives the subject just a little boost and helps draw the viewer’s eye to the subject in a rather subtle way.  A little grain and sometimes a slight vignette are generally the final touches in the LR edit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-49614" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-840x393.jpg" alt="Before and After, Creating a “Storybook” Image in Lightroom and Photoshop Elements by Jan Tyler" width="840" height="393" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-840x393.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-420x196.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-330x154.jpg 330w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4-690x323.jpg 690w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Before-and-After-Creating-a-“Storybook”-Image-in-Lightroom-and-Photoshop-Elements-by-Jan-Tyler-4.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>From here, the real fun begins. I open the image in PS and think about the finishing touches and details that will give this image the “storybook” quality I am looking for. (right click, edit in Adobe Photoshop Elements Editor with Lightroom adjustments)</p>
<p>In this image, I brought back a bit of the blue sky &#8211; again, not a lot, but just enough to complement the greens.</p>
<p>I also brought back a bit of the natural light that was glowing in the right side of the frame. For this, I used a light overlay set to blending mode “Screen”, and reduced the opacity until it was a faint glow.</p>
<p>I duplicated the layer and applied a slight radial blur set to “Multiply” in the blending mode. I reduced the opacity to about 24 and masked it off of my subject at 50%. The total effect is very slight, but, again, just enough to make the subject stand out a bit in the scene and to draw the viewer’s eye to the intended subject.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2022-01-07-Blog-Banner.jpg" title="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" alt="2022-01-07 Blog Banner" /></div>
<p>Strictly for fun, and a creative break from reality, I added some rainbow overlays in varying modes (screen and soft light) and varying opacities, and slightly masked off in some areas.</p>
<p>As a final “storybook” touch, I added some textures. My favorite textures add a rich depth of tones, mostly to the edges, without affecting the colors of the image itself significantly. I oftentimes convert the textures to black and white (Enhance, convert to Black and White) to add the literal texture to the image with no color.  The textures chosen here are from <a href="https://jessicadrossin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Drossin</a> and remind me of a linen classic “storybook” page.  They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Batik (blending mode: soft light ; opacity 35%)</li>
<li> Mesh (converted to black and white, blending mode: color burn; opacity 28%)</li>
<li>Mesh (blending mode: color burn; opacity 4%)</li>
</ol>
<p>I flattened the image and saved it with the new adjustments.</p>

<p>In LR I lifted the shadows, blacks, and whites. I often do this in my “storybook” images if I am trying to portray “carefree” and “happy”.  I adjusted the clarity and the tone panel just a bit to bring out some of definition from the work I did in PSE.</p>

<p class="size-full wp-image-40429 alignleft">As is true with any editing you do, you will need to tweak these steps to fit your own story elements. If my methods and ways seem a bit unorthodox, this may be because I taught myself LR and PSE simply by playing, experimenting, exploring, and FAILING… a LOT! “Reset”, “undo”, and “erase” are definitely my most-used commands. So, really, all you need is a mind open to adventure and the willingness to explore… and remember, when you are being creative and creating your own “storybook” image, really, anything goes!</p>

<p>I have shot my fair share of landscapes…of flowers…of buildings…of babies…of sunsets…of friends and relatives…and I love all of those images. Honestly, I really, really love them. I am delighted to give gifts and to make others happy through images. It continually challenges me and pushes me in different ways, and I am sincerely grateful for that push.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone that is familiar with my work at all knows one thing…I love to shoot ONE subject.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>One. One subject. One child. One Boy.</p>
<p>I have shot my fair share of landscapes…of flowers…of buildings…of babies…of sunsets…of friends and relatives…and I love all of those images. Honestly, I really, really love them. I am delighted to give gifts and to make others happy through images. It continually challenges me and pushes me in different ways, and I am sincerely grateful for that push.</p>
<p>Those images, however, are not where my Creative Heart truly lies; where my Mommy Heart lies. I really and truly love to shoot one subject.</p>
<p>Over the course of my photography journey, I have had so many people ask me legitimate questions, such as: <em>Doesn’t he ever get tired of having his picture taken? How can you come up with new ideas? How do you keep from burning out? What do you do if you are in a rut?</em></p>
<p>I wish I had one perfect answer for all of those questions, but, unfortunately, I do not. I will, however, share with you a few ideas that have helped both of us along the way.</p>
<h2>1. Let go</h2>
<p>I have to admit that my son has a lot more energy than I have…a lot more enthusiasm and zest for life…a lot more imagination. Any idea that I would even attempt to envision looks tired and boring compared to his. If you see an image of mine that has energy and imagination—guaranteed it was his idea. For example, my idea was to take a picture of him eating his favorite candy&#8230;</p>

<p>My idea was for him to hold an orange. His idea was to peel the orange and throw the little pieces of orange peel at my face&#8230;</p>

<p>I’m sure you can guess which images have the most energy and capture the most natural expressions, the most authentic smiles, and the most fun and laughter. So, let go. Let your child lead. You may have a bit of a mess to clean up, but it will definitely be worth it…and they will enjoy that time you spent together so much more.</p>
<h2>2. Create a series</h2>
<p>This is a wonderful way to document events, places, or periods in your child’s life. I have completed several different “chapters” in this great photography project of ours. We have done a series on his favorite candies&#8230;</p>

<p>Using a series is such a wonderful way to show change over time. What is so important today will be a memory soon enough.</p>
<h2>3. Use a new lens</h2>
<p>It is so amazing how the exact same type of image can take on an entirely different look with a new lens.  These are both basic portraits. One is taken with a 50mm, the other with a <a href="http://lensbaby.com/" target="_blank">Lensbaby</a>.</p>

<p>I would probably still be content with that camera if it weren’t for the fact that one day this little guy began to move, really move, and he was FAST! My poor little camera could not capture much more than a blur. It was then that I started researching dSLR cameras and decided that a fast shutter speed was exactly what I needed to capture this speedy little guy.  I decided on the Nikon d40, and was thrilled that I was able to actually capture him in motion. I was drawn to his joy and exuberance, and was so pleased with the images I was producing. It was also at this time that I learned that “editing” was truly the way to move an image from “good” to “great”…enter Picasa and Picnik.</p>

<p>I was so happy with the images I was producing now, I could have easily stayed right there in that happy little spot…until, one day I received the horrible news that Picnik would be shutting down. I forced myself to look for an editing program replacement and happened upon Lightroom. It was an overwhelming program, but I was determined to learn it.</p>
<p>In my search for Lightroom tutorials, I happened upon a wonderful little community of photographers called <a href="http://theclickcommunity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a>. I bought a year-long membership that day…and my life has really never been the same since.  I spent the next several months studying the work of all of the wonderful ladies at CM. I studied the picture shares and the serious critiques. I giggled through the progress threads. I read every comment ever written. It was during this time that I decided that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I needed a new camera.</li>
<li>I should learn to shoot in manual.</li>
<li>Bokeh was good.</li>
<li>I wanted to document what life was like with a little boy…and I wanted to do it well.</li>
</ol>

<p>I bought a Lifetime membership to Clickin Moms and my Nikon d7000 that summer, and decided I would shoot in manual with it from the start. I signed up for my first CM Workshop in September of 2012 to learn the basics. It was during this workshop that I met my close group of photography “sisters” that would continue to be my support both in life and in photography over the next two years. (…and, incidentally, both my life and my photography would be a mess without them.)</p>

<p>After my first workshop, I was hooked. All I could think about was photography, and my desire to improve.  In January 2013 I started a mad rush of CM Workshops.  In these amazing workshops, I learned how to find and Master the Natural Light Inside my home:</p>

<p>I learned how to include Lifestyle in my work:</p>

<p>I ventured in to a course on Fine Art and Visual Expression; I learned about Composition and Creativity, and also about the Elements of Design.</p>

<p>It was during <a href="http://emmawoodphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Wood</a>’s amazing Timeless class in October of that year that I feel like I truly found my voice. I discovered the type of images that made my heart sing, and I knew what I wanted to create.  Just after finishing the course, I applied, and was delightfully surprised to find that I had made <a href="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/cmpro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMPro</a>.</p>

<p>I will be completely honest and admit that even though I had been accepted to Pro, my photography was still not where I wanted it to be. I knew what I wanted to create, but I wasn’t completely there yet. I wanted to grow even more…and in some ways, I feel like I have grown the MOST since being accepted. After becoming a CMPro, I was determined to keep learning, to experiment, and to bring my images to a new level. I attribute all of my growth and development during this year to personal challenges, small group projects, and, of course, more workshops…all within the wonderful CM community.</p>
<p>I continued my love for CM Workshops by learning to use the Art of Observation and Communicating with Color and Light…I also, simultaneously, embarked on a “Lensbaby challenge” in which I challenged myself to use the <a href="http://lensbaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensbaby</a> exclusively for one year.</p>

<p>The first few Lensbaby images were a bit hit or miss…but I have really grown to love and appreciate the imperfection and the softness of that lens.</p>
<p>In spring of that year I had a pivotal moment in my learning. I took <a href="http://www.katetparkerphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Parker</a>’s phenomenal Turning Lifestyle Photography into Art workshop. This class allowed me to open my mind and start to see the world with my mind and with my heart…instead of solely with my eyes. It was during this class that I opened up Photoshop…and my editing (and my life) have never been the same.</p>

<p>This year I have also participated in group projects—a Boyhood project, a Fine Art project, and a Life in Color project. Each one has pushed me and challenged me to explore and try new things. I also joined in monthly challenges with a small group of CMPros. The support and encouragement, as well as the friendship these small groups provided really has been immeasurable.</p>

<p>I really cannot thank the wonderfully supportive community that is Clickin Moms enough for being with me, truly, every step of this journey. I am looking forward to continuing my growth in workshops this year, by working on some new personal projects, and by playing with my new Nikon d750. I would really like to encourage you to find a personal project that makes your heart sing…to become involved in the small group offerings here at CM…to take a workshop…to challenge yourself…</p>
<p>I just know you will be amazed at what you discover about yourself and your work.</p>

<p>I would be remiss not to mention what a wonderfully loving and supportive family I have. This group has been with me every step of the way…and these projects would not even be an option without these beautiful, smiling faces.</p>

<p>It is easy to play with the light at my window.</p>
<p>When the sun is strong, we hang a little curtain to soften it.</p>

<p>Sometimes we add our own overhead lights for fun.</p>
