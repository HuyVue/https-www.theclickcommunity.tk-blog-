					<description><![CDATA[This is such a hard thing for me to grasp. You worded it beautifully and I fully understand it. But when I get in front of the photos I like the moody light but than in the summer I like the bright light and warm colors. I can’t seem to find anything that while I’m editing it is consistent. For instance, lately I have been trying warm and bright. But when I post them to  social media’s and compare next to that post they seem either too warm, or not bright enough, or too bright. Like they never seem to perfectly mesh. It is a work in progress! But this article for sure did help me gather some thoughts. Thanks so much!]]></description>

I understand EXACTLY what you&#039;re talking about and how you feel. I love seeing moody photos but when I go to edit my own images, it&#039;s not what I see in my mind&#039;s eye or feel in my heart. That&#039;s why I think that whole section on owning who you are is so important. I&#039;ve wondered if there&#039;s a place for my style, but I&#039;ve learned I have to create what makes my own heart content and not try to copy anyone else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, and totally timely for me. I set out this winter to &quot;develop my style&quot; in my slow season. I had noticed that I was attracted to a lot of moody images, but it wasn&#039;t what I was shooting. I took a break out class, watched lots of editing videos, read articles, and started trying it more on my own. But then I found that the moodiness didn&#039;t match the feeling I generally have with my family (my primary subjects, especially in winter). So I&#039;ve owned up to my personal style, but I&#039;m also glad I have some tools in my pocket for variety. And I still LOVE seeing those moody images when I scroll through other posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really love this article. I am always working on my style. Never really seem to get what is in my head.

Another point is some of this advice could be used with clients, they could use it to tell you what they are looking for.]]></description>
