					<description><![CDATA[What a wonderfully unique and refreshing post, Kellie!  I&#039;m in the midst of writing/crumpling/screaming at my artist&#039;s statement, which is on the same level of painful as a bio...  so this really hit home for me.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kellie, what an interesting topic. I can SO relate. As I was building my site, I just cruised along designing layouts, retouching my portfolio photos, writing out my services....but when it came to the &quot;about me&quot; page, I was stuck. It took me weeks and weeks to write something....anything....I can&#039;t say I&#039;m thrilled about what I have now but I basically just got tired of re-writing it and put it away for a year. I love your idea of the different version of ourselves. I think you hit the nail on the head. How can we possibly describe ourselves when we our complex beings? I love you article. thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kellie, my curiosity got the best of me and I had to check out your &#039;About Me&#039; page on your website. I absolutely loved it! Beautiful pictures. I love the warmth you&#039;re able to capture in the pictures. If you&#039;re ever in sunny California, I&#039;d love to have a cup of coffee with you and for you to take pictures of my growing family. All my best!]]></description>
