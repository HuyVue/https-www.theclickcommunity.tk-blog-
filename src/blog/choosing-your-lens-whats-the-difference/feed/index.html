					<description><![CDATA[LOVE to see the same shot (basically;) w/the 3 different lens&#039;s!  I shoot w/2 cameras, one I typically use my basic 18-55 (boring but I can get great shots w/it;) &#038; the other one w/my &quot;crush&quot; my 135L.......although it DOES make ME work......I get plenty of exercise during my shoots;)!
I am looking for a new &quot;in between&quot; lens, I&#039;m liking the 24-70 maybe:)  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/choosing-your-lens-whats-the-difference/#comment-61731&quot;&gt;Lani&lt;/a&gt;.

hi Lani, well &#039;sparkles&#039; isn&#039;t a technical term =) but anyone can do this.  basically it&#039;s done with backlighting your subject, being low enough for the light to stream through trees and having a wider aperture.  that&#039;s what helps create the pretty circles of light that you see.  hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post! I am always interested in what lenses different photographers use. I don&#039;t have an 85mm but I do have a 50mm and love it. Hubby just got me a 35mm for Christmas! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great article.  I love the side by side comparisons.  It really helps me visualize what lens I need to complete the photo shoot &#034;package&#034;.  I love variety, and this helps get my wheels turning. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Leah! This was super helpful! It made me realize that I love the sparkles too and didn&#039;t really realize that the 50 was &#034;known&#034; for that! I have been looking into the 24-70 and love that this shows that you can get bokeh with this lens too. ]]></description>
