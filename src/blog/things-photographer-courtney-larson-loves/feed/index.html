					<description><![CDATA[Really like it when they do the top ten things. I like to look through and see what i have in common...

Sorry have to confess i am more Costa than Starbucks and ankle boots really dont suit me.

I havent got the 135mm (yet) but have been thinking about it.

Shadows just love them. 

Goodwill? Im thinking this could be like charity shops or table top sales? If so i am there every day...]]></description>
