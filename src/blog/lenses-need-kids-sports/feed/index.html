					<description><![CDATA[Hi, thank you for your article. I am new to this camera world, it was a wedding present and I am planning on using it a lot during my son&#039;s basketball and football games. I will be sitting in the stands and want to get a picture where he doesn&#039;t look like an ant when I view the picture. I have the Canon EOS Rebel T6. I primarily have been using the EFS-18-55mm and it&#039;s not a good fit for taking sport photos. Would the 70-300mm f/4-5.6 be a better bet? Thank you for your help! Have a great day]]></description>

Hi Martha! Since you are usually going to be outside, I would worry less about aperture and more about getting a good long focal length. A zoom would be most versatile, so I would look into the 70-300mm lens to help you get those shots on the field.]]></description>

Hi Tim! So glad you found this article helpful! A 70-300 will definitely serve you well when photographing the kids&#039; sports as it has a great range and reach and comes with image stabilization, too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, there is some great information here. I for sure need to read up on all these numbers. We bought a nikon d3100 about 5 years ago and haven&#039;t really used it other than to take baby photos and lately its just been sitting in the cabinet. Now that our kids are involved in outdoor sports we would like to capture those game winning goals up close. Would you recommend the 70-300mm f/4-5.6 for this. We are a family on a budget so that $2,000 lens is not an option.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article!  I am using a Canon 80D with the Canon 70-200 f/2.8 for photographing indoor and outdoor swimming as well as HS soccer and lacrosse.  The only issue I find is that I can&#039;t reach the opposite end of the field with this lens.  Some of the outdoor games are at night, under the lights so it seems like a fast lens is a must.  Would I better with a longer zoom or an extender?  Any suggestions?]]></description>

A good option for you might be the 85mm 1.8. It is around $350. On the T6 you would actually get approx. 136mm of reach (because of the cropped sensor) and it opens up nice and wide to let more light in which is key for gymnastics. The 75-300 is great for track but not as much for gymnastics (unless you take your ISO really high so that you can get a higher shutter speed.) I hope that helps!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon!  I just purchased the Canon Rebel T6 and it comes with a 18-55mm lens.  I will primarily be using this for my daughter&#039;s gymnastics meets and son&#039;s track meets.  After reading your article it seems that I need to purchase another lens, especially for the indoor-no flash allowed-gymnastics meets.  What budget friendly lens do you recommend?  I had looked at the 75-300mm lens but read somewhere that it really needed to be on a tripod in order to prevent blurry images.  Any thoughts or suggestions?]]></description>

Christina, the 70-200 will most definitely give you better low light performance (which you definitely appreciate at dance classes and recitals!) while the 70-300 would give you that extra long reach that you might appreciate more during the outdoor events. I would rent both and see which serves you best and purchase from there :)]]></description>
