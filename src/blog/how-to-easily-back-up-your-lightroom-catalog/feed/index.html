					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reminder to back up the LR Catalogs, Jamie! Do you know if it is important to also backup, to a 2nd and 3rd drive, the Catalog Previews folder? That folder seems to contain tens of thousands of items, and I just wasn&#039;t sure if it was necessary to make sure those are duplicated to additional external drives. Or rather, it is just the Catalog and the folder of the backups of the catalog?]]></description>
