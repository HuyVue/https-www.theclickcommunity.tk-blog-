					<description><![CDATA[A really cool photo.
I do prefer the brighter edit though.
I think the story you wanted to tell is of her independence. The way you framed the photo does that by itself. Keeping the forest dark makes it seem dangerous, menacing and obviously, she doesn&#039;t see it that way. She doesn&#039;t feel threatened. Maybe it&#039;s your instinct as a parent, to look for dangers where there are none? I think this darker edit tells us much more about you than about your child or the story:).]]></description>
