					<description><![CDATA[I love The Family Photographer.  It&#039;s one of my favorites while I walk at lunch. Great information with some laughs about how kids  are unpredictable but oh so sweet. Those moments don&#039;t last long.  Thank you for your list!  I look forward to checking these out!]]></description>

Hi Tarah! Glad you enjoy the show. There are so, so many podcasts to listen to. And so many KINDS. I love 99% Invisible and recently started listening to Hidden Brain. Do you know Kristen Kalp&#039;s - That&#039;s what she said? An all time favorite was the first season of First Day Back by Tally Abecassis. None of those are photography related!

Podcasts about photography that are great - Valerie Jardin&#039;s Street Focus and The Candid Frame. A new one is Outerfocus.]]></description>
