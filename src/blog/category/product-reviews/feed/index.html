			<p>Let&#8217;s face it, sometimes the lines in our photos aren&#8217;t perfectly straight.</p>
<p>Gasp!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true but you&#8217;re in luck because there is an easy fix. Lightroom has a great feature for correcting lines, the Transform Panel.</p>
<p>The Transform Panel, located in Lightroom&#8217;s Develop Module after the Lens Correction Panel and before the Effects Panel, is a handy little tool that tends to get overlooked. It is great for fixing those distracting lens distortions that usually come when using a wide-angle lens.</p>
<p>With a few simple steps, your image can go from a little wonky to perfectly straight in just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll find a quick video showing you how I use the Transform Panel when straightening out lines and distortion. I&#8217;d also like to take a moment to clarify some options you&#8217;ll find in the  Transform Panel.</p>
<p>Within the Transform Panel, you will find five Upright options you can use. This is what the options do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto:</strong> Fixes vertical and horizontal distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Guided:</strong> Instead of just one guide, this allows you to create two or more.</li>
<li><strong>Level:</strong> Fixes horizontal distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical:</strong> Fixes vertical distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Full:</strong> Combines auto, level and vertical corrections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the Upright options you&#8217;ll find seven sliders: Vertical, Horizontal, Rotate, Aspect, Scale, X Offset and Y Offset. Use the slider to manually adjust the perspective within your photo.</p>
<p>Sometimes correcting lines and distortion is a subtle fix like the example I&#8217;m using here and sometimes it&#8217;s a major fix. Whichever it is for you and your image, I guarantee it won&#8217;t be as difficult as you may originally think.</p>

<p>Have you been eyeballing a new photography product? Would you like to hear a Pro’s opinion on the product prior to purchasing? We have a new series for you, Click It and Pick It, where the CMpros will be reviewing several of the most talked about photo products! In this installment of the Click It and Pick It series, CMpro <a href="http://www.karynleeportrait.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karyn Lee</a> takes <a href="https://www.shootproof.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShootProof</a> for a spin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40588" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/event-organizer-in-ShootProof.png" alt="event organizer in ShootProof" width="840" height="585" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/event-organizer-in-ShootProof.png 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/event-organizer-in-ShootProof-420x292.png 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/event-organizer-in-ShootProof-700x487.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>How was the ordering process?</h2>
<p>I was really excited to try out ShootProof. I had been looking for an online system for selling prints for a while, so when testing ShootProof was offered to me, I was pretty excited. Once my account was ready to go, I was able to get to work setting it up right away. The interface is pretty easy, but I still managed to get myself lost in the back end. However, a quick call to Customer Support got me sorted out &#8211; they really took care of me there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40589" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pricing-structure-in-ShootProof.png" alt="pricing structure in ShootProof" width="840" height="456" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pricing-structure-in-ShootProof.png 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pricing-structure-in-ShootProof-420x228.png 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pricing-structure-in-ShootProof-700x380.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>What was your first impressions of ShootProof?</h2>
<p>I really love how I can upload several folders as one big upload, and that it keeps those folders sorted for me &#8211; as I do a lot of large volume shoots like dance schools and grad classes, this allows me to keep all the client orders separate with their own individual links and passwords &#8211; privacy is so important! I have also been able to build several different price lists and packages, as each session I do requires one of several different price lists.</p>
<h2>How will you use the product and how do you think your clients will use it?</h2>
<p>The best part though is how thrilled my clients are with this! I began with ShootProof just after I incorporated another photographer&#8217;s studio into my own as he retired. He had always been very traditional with his process, and having his previous clients beginning to work with me, they were all extremely happy that they were not only able to place orders online, but also that we now accepted credit cards (through PayPal). I also find in cases of split families, when I am working with classes, split families aren&#8217;t shuffling hard-copy proofs from house to house. Because I am not physically handing and sorting proof packages, proofs are delivered to my clients about a week earlier than they used to be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40587" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Album-display-in-ShootProof.png" alt="Album display in ShootProof" width="840" height="811" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Album-display-in-ShootProof.png 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Album-display-in-ShootProof-420x405.png 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Album-display-in-ShootProof-700x675.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>Anything else you wish to share?</h2>
<p>I really enjoy the options with gallery layout and viewing options &#8211; my one minor complaint is that you must choose one of their colour schemes, rather than being able to customize it myself to my business colours. Because I do so much volume work, I chose the plan with 15,000 for $30 a month. I look at this as a comparison between my proofing costs before vs after. What one printed proof set for one class costs, ShootProof costs me for all my classes &#8211; the savings have been huge!</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;m very happy with ShootProof, and would truly recommend it to anyone &#8211; high or low volume!</p>

<p>There are things you just expect from your gear: that your lenses will focus, that they’ll attain apertures that deliver the impact of depth of field, that they’re tack-sharp — you know, table stakes. But then there’s the intangible, the hard-to-put-your-finger-on-it &#8220;thing&#8221; &#8211; the way your equipment renders an image, the way it handles depth of field, tonality, and light &#8211; that makes a camera and lens more desirable than any other.</p>
<p>I NEED my equipment to work for me. To help me turn this vision in my head into reality. I need my gear to not just allow “me” — my voice, my style — to come through in my work, but to facilitate it. I need my camera and lenses to help me achieve the “me” in my work.</p>
<p>My photographic style very much mirrors my personal style. When it comes to my maternity and newborn work, I love simple and soft, clean lines and a neutral palette, organic and a bit earthy. My goal during a shoot is to help my clients remember. Whether it’s how gorgeous a mother looked carrying her baby, or how their newborn has dad’s nose and mom’s lips, or how beautiful this tiny little miracle looked when they slept…it’s the little things, the simple yet important things that are the focus of my work. I want my images to carry clients back in time, remembering exactly how they felt at that very moment. My Nikon gear helps me tell that story.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/dslr-cameras/D800.html" target="_blank">Nikon D800</a></strong>:  Camera choice is such a personal decision, you know? It’s more than the images it produces (those implicit table stakes), it’s about how it feels in your hands. Everything about the D800 is a good fit for me. I love the color it gives me; it reminds me somewhat of film. I love that I can make so many quick adjustments without having to pull the camera from my face. Don’t underestimate the importance of button placement, especially the toggler for focus points. I’m sure it has a more technical name, but that toggler makes me very happy.</p>
<p>Oh, and metering off of any focus point — love it. All the features, both small and large, come together and make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Like I said, camera choice is a highly personal thing.  <em>For me, the Nikon D800 feels just right in my hands.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2egHxjO" target="_blank">AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.4G</a></strong>:  This little guy is on my camera 75 percent of the time during newborn sessions. The focal length is perfect — no distortion — and the transition in and out of the focal plane is so soft, which complements these sweet little ones so well. Plus it’s super-fast to focus, even in low light, which means I get the shot and move on (before this little one wakes up and decides he&#8217;s had enough).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/Micro-NIKKOR-105mm-f%252F2.8.html" target="_blank"><strong>AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 IF-ED</strong></a>:  I have a love affair with newborn macro. There is something so special about the unique characteristics of a newborn. It’s those little things that mom and dad are already in love with, the little things these parents will look back on and laugh over, or feel sentimental about, and remind them how fast their babies have grown up. I love that I’m able to give them those memories, and I love my Micro-Nikkor 105mm, for that and many reasons. This baby is sharp, y’all! And, in case you hadn’t noticed the recurring theme in what I love about my favorite lenses, this, too, has creamy, delicious bokeh.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39420" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/close-up-newborn-photo-by-Austin-photographer-Jenni-Jones1.jpg" alt="close up newborn photo by Austin photographer Jenni Jones" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/close-up-newborn-photo-by-Austin-photographer-Jenni-Jones1.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/close-up-newborn-photo-by-Austin-photographer-Jenni-Jones1-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/close-up-newborn-photo-by-Austin-photographer-Jenni-Jones1-700x466.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-NIKKOR-85mm-f%252F1.4G.html" target="_blank"><strong>AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4G</strong></a>:  If I’m shooting outdoors, this is the lens on my camera. I’m a fairly wide-open shooter, and the buttery, creamy bokeh this lens delivers is almost edible (or maybe I&#8217;m just hungry). There’s just something about the focal length that allows you to be both a viewer and a participant in the story. While I’ve heard amazing things about Nikon’s other 85mm lenses, this model’s ability to be both sharp and creamy at the same time makes it the only 85mm lens for me, especially when I’m shooting at f/1.4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Sponsored by <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Camera-Lenses/index.page?cid=prnt-0714-tip-click-tamaralackey#c54-CID-1380035722687-tab-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon</a></p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Camera-Lenses/index.page?cid=prnt-0714-tip-click-tamaralackey#c54-CID-1380035722687-tab-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon</a> photographer <a href="http://tamaralackey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Lackey</a> heads out on location for a family session, two lenses are almost guaranteed to be in her bag: the AF-S NIKKOR 24-70mm f/2.8G ED and AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4G, with the AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II also a frequent flier.</p>
<p>For this shoot, Tamara knew she&#8217;d be shooting both indoors and out, and these three lenses gave her the flexibility she needed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39015" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mom-and-daughter-portrait-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg" alt="mom and daughter portrait by Tamara Lackey" width="600" height="366" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mom-and-daughter-portrait-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg 600w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mom-and-daughter-portrait-by-Tamara-Lackey-420x256.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><strong>1. If she could use only one lens&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>It would be the <a href="http://amzn.to/2e8ZoWa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AF-S NIKKOR 24-70mm f/2.8G ED</a>. “When I do not know what I am walking into, which happens more frequently than one might guess when photographing children, I grab this lens first,” she says. Though it’s gained a reputation as a classic workhorse lens, Tamara likes the fast, smooth zoom operation and precise capture it provides, even with fast motion. It’s definitely the lens she would choose if she could only have one to cover a variety of situations. “I can effortlessly shoot with it using only one hand on the camera and one hand on a reflector,” she adds, “and that is a major plus. I’m a big fan.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39014" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/girl-sitting-in-the-grass-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg" alt="girl sitting in the grass photo by Tamara Lackey" width="500" height="347" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/girl-sitting-in-the-grass-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg 500w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/girl-sitting-in-the-grass-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey-420x291.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2><strong>2. Beautiful bokeh with no distortion&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>Tamara says the images she can capture with the <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-NIKKOR-85mm-f%252F1.4G.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4G</a> are &#8220;soft and dreamy and delicious.&#8221; As one of her favorite portrait lenses, Tamara loves that she can get razor-sharp focus and still lose anything she doesn’t want in the frame by selecting a shallow depth of field, all while getting beautiful bokeh. “There’s no distortion with this lens and, it has a nice heft to it,” she says. “I love its crisp, dependable capture.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39013" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/black-and-white-family-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg" alt="black and white family photo by Tamara Lackey" width="500" height="749" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/black-and-white-family-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey.jpg 500w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/black-and-white-family-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey-280x420.jpg 280w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/black-and-white-family-photo-by-Tamara-Lackey-467x700.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2><strong>3. When her subjects need a little space&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>Tamara calls the <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-NIKKOR-70-200mm-f%252F2.8G-ED-VR-II.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II</a> lens her “give my subject space lens.” Touting that it’s “fabulous” for action and distant subjects, Tamara finds the vibration reduction so effective that she can avoid tripods most of the time—a big plus in her book. “But one of the key reasons I choose this lens is to give my subjects a bit more freedom and space from the camera,” she says, noting it helps her get more relaxed expressions and change the dynamic of the shoot. The f/2.8 speed creates soft backgrounds while still locking in sharply-focused subjects. “Pairing this with my Nikon D4 allows me all kinds of freedom to confidently shoot fast-moving subjects, cranking up the fast shutter speed to freeze all the fun, sporty action,” she says. No wonder it’s often found on location with her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been eyeballing a new photography product? Would you like to hear a Pro&#8217;s opinion on the product prior to purchasing? We have a new series for you, Click It and Pick It, where the CMpros will be reviewing several of the most talked about photo products! In this installment of the Click It and Pick It series, CMpro <a href="http://www.katiewoodardphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie Woodard</a> takes the <a href="http://www.fundysoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #000000;">Fundy Software</span></a> for a spin.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">fundy software</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36555" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Opening-Screen-of-Fundy-Software.jpg" alt="Opening Screen of Fundy Software" width="750" height="469" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Opening-Screen-of-Fundy-Software.jpg 750w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Opening-Screen-of-Fundy-Software-420x262.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Opening-Screen-of-Fundy-Software-400x250.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Opening-Screen-of-Fundy-Software-700x437.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">How long did it take to get the product?</span></h4>
<p>Fundy Album Builder is an immediate download.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">What were your first impressions of the product?</span></h4>
<p>My first impression of Fundy Album Designer was that it is very easy to learn and very user friendly.</p>
<div><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36554" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-screenshot-after-loading-images.jpg" alt="Fundy screenshot after loading images" width="750" height="469" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-screenshot-after-loading-images.jpg 750w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-screenshot-after-loading-images-420x262.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-screenshot-after-loading-images-400x250.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-screenshot-after-loading-images-700x437.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></div>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">How would you use the product? </span></h4>
<p>I am able to design a photo album with Fundy Album Builder in about 15 minutes! There are so many lab choices already built in to the Album Designer software. I can quickly put together an album preview to show clients.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Is the product accessible to your clients? In other words, is this something you can see your clients wanting and is it something you are comfortable offering?</span></h4>
<p>A photography client may not need this software, but I can put together a sample album for a client very quickly by using Fundy.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">How would/does Album Builder fit in with your work flow / studio business?</span></h4>
<p>Album Builder is extremely easy to learn and easy to use! Fundy album designer would increase my options of sales without spending hours designing an album layout. I design them in less than 15 minutes now! And when I&#8217;m ready to export, I get the choices of saving for print, proof or web.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">What feature/tool in the program do you find particularly useful?</span></h4>
<p>I love that once I import and drag the photos onto the pages, if I want to change a particular layout, Fundy pops up 12 other layout choices for the page I want to change. This gives me ideas for layouts that I would not have thought of!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36553" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-gives-you-options-for-different-layouts.jpg" alt="Fundy gives you options for different layouts" width="750" height="469" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-gives-you-options-for-different-layouts.jpg 750w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-gives-you-options-for-different-layouts-420x262.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-gives-you-options-for-different-layouts-400x250.jpg 400w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fundy-gives-you-options-for-different-layouts-700x437.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">RFi Speedlight Speedring and Softbox RFi Octa 3’ review</span></h2>
<h4><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36410" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Profoto-softbox-RFi-3-Octa-840x559.jpg" alt="Profoto softbox RFi 3 Octa" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Profoto-softbox-RFi-3-Octa-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Profoto-softbox-RFi-3-Octa-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Profoto-softbox-RFi-3-Octa-700x465.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Profoto-softbox-RFi-3-Octa.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">How long did it take to get the product?</span></h4>
<p>Shipping from Profoto was very quick; I was excited to receive the box a few days after my order was placed.  Everything was well-packaged to protect it during transit, so it arrived on my doorstep with no issues.  When I opened the package I was happy to find a sheet giving detailed instructions for setup &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have to search through the box or look online.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">What were your first impressions of the product?</span></h4>
<p>Like all Profoto products, the RFi Speedlight Speedring and Softbox RFi Octa 3’ are very well made.  I use a lot of softboxes and attachments, and Profoto always stands out as the most sturdy/durable brand out there.  The Speedring and the Softbox did not disappoint; they are NOT constructed from flimsy materials, so I was comfortable taking them out into the elements.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36411" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wedding-portrait-by-Michelle-Turner-840x559.jpg" alt="wedding portrait by Michelle Turner" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wedding-portrait-by-Michelle-Turner-840x559.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wedding-portrait-by-Michelle-Turner-420x279.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wedding-portrait-by-Michelle-Turner-700x465.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wedding-portrait-by-Michelle-Turner.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">How would you use the product? </span></h4>
<p>I use my off camera flash at weddings, portraits, and commercial sessions.  I tend to swap back and forth between my speedlight and the Profoto B1, and in the past it has required me to switch between light modifiers as well.  I&#8217;m so pleased that the Speedring makes Profoto&#8217;s light shaping tools compatible with all of my lights &#8211; now I only have to bring one or two modifiers which work easily with all of my lighting gear.</p>
<p>I was absolutely thrilled to find that the Profoto Speedring ALSO lets me add a second or third speedlight to the setup, allowing me to increase the power of my light beyond what one single speedlight is capable of.  You can easily add two or more speedlights to your off camera flash setup, allowing you to push the power of your speedlight setup to overpower the sun!  I wasn&#8217;t expecting this, and it is a huge selling point for the Speedring.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-36408" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride-and-groom-kissing-with-the-sunset-photo-by-Michelle-Turner-840x560.jpg" alt="bride and groom kissing with the sunset photo by Michelle Turner" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride-and-groom-kissing-with-the-sunset-photo-by-Michelle-Turner-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride-and-groom-kissing-with-the-sunset-photo-by-Michelle-Turner-420x280.jpg 420w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride-and-groom-kissing-with-the-sunset-photo-by-Michelle-Turner-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride-and-groom-kissing-with-the-sunset-photo-by-Michelle-Turner.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<div>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">What do you think of product quality and price point? </span></h4>
</div>
<p>I tend to ruin a handful of modifiers per year &#8211; overuse, travel, and/or exposure to wind/rain will really take a toll on some of the more flimsy modifiers out there.  Profoto&#8217;s Octagonal Softbox is a piece of equipment that can last your entire career.  While it is more expensive than some other brands out there, it&#8217;s worth every penny when you don&#8217;t have to constantly fix it in the field or replace it.  My lighting assistant remarked several times on the durability; we were shooting with the Profoto setup on the Maine coast, and he never had to fix or adjust the Softbox due to the wind.</p>
<div>
<h4><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Anything else you wish to share about this product?</span></h4>
</div>
<p>I am really pleased with how the Profoto&#8217;s Speedring and Octagonal Softbox performed in the field.  I was already a fan of Profoto&#8217;s light shaping tools (since I use them with the Profoto B1), but I&#8217;m excited to find that I can now use them with my Nikon speedlights as well.  I really do believe that Profoto makes the nicest light shaping tools on the market, and the speedring makes them accessible to everyone, regardless of what type of off camera light you favor!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may be seeing photographers share photos with delicious blur – they very well may have been taken with one of the many <a href="http://lensbaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lensbaby</a> lenses. Whether you’ve never heard of these before, just getting started with yours, or looking for more tips on using a Lensbaby, this post is for you!</p>
<p>I never leave my house without one of these. It’s true – my camera bag is my purse, and even if I leave my camera at home, I will usually find a Lensbaby nestled next to my iPad and my wallet. Lensbaby lenses let your creativity soar. The images you make with them are so unique that it is difficult to reproduce them by yourself.  Eventually, you will learn to pre-visualize your scene in “Lensbaby,” knowing where you want the focus to fall, and what part of the frame will disintegrate into blur.</p>

<h4>What is a Lensbaby?</h4>
<p>Lensbaby makes a line of tilt-focus lenses that create very unique images with an area of sharp focus, surrounded by fading blur. Lensbaby lenses are different from traditional tilt-shift lenses in that there is no shifting mechanism – you cannot slide the lens up, down, or sideways while it is mounted on your camera. However, you can tilt the lens (like a tilt-shift lens) which allows the photographer to shift the area of focus in the image they make.</p>
<p>Lensbaby lenses do not communicate with your camera in any way. This means that you will have to manually set the aperture of the lens and manually focus your lens.</p>

<h4>Understanding the equipment</h4>
<p>Lensbaby lenses have two parts, lens body and optic.</p>
<p>Lensbaby used to manufacture several different lens bodies, but at this point they are focused on making and selling their best, the Composer Pro. The Composer Pro has a part that attaches to your camera (they make mounts that suit all major brands), a part that attaches to the lens optic, and a tilting mechanism between them (which is really a ball joint).</p>
<p>Lensbaby makes many different optics, but the most popular ones are Sweet 35 (35mm), Double Glass (50mm), and Edge 80 (80mm).</p>
<p>Both Sweet 35 and Double Glass optics give you a circular area of focus (the so-called “sweet spot”), while the Edge 80 gives you the slice of focus.</p>
<p>The biggest plus of the Sweet 35 and Edge 80 optics is that you can control the aperture by simply twisting a ring on the optic. Double Glass optic has aperture discs that you can exchange using a little magnetic tool.</p>

<p>You need just one Composer Pro lens body;  all the optics are interchangeable.</p>
<h4>Is Lensbaby for you?</h4>
<p>Just because you love looking at images with lots of blur, it does not necessarily mean that you will love making them. Enter the Lensbaby Spark, to which I frequently refer to as the “Gateway Lensbaby.” The Spark is a one-piece Lensbaby that has an optic already attached to an accordion-type tilting mechanism.  It is a 50mm lens with a fixed f/5.6 aperture.  At $90, it is most certainly a bargain.</p>
<p>The Spark is how I started out. I had mine for exactly 3 days before I realized that I loved the images I was making and I was ready to jump all in. I then bought a Composer Pro with Sweet 35 optic. Thus, my love affair with Lensbaby began.</p>

<h4>Practicing Manual Focus</h4>
<p>As I mentioned above, Lensbaby lenses do not communicate with your camera, and you will need to focus them manually. While this sounds daunting at first, learning manual focus will improve your photography, period. It is a great skill to have, and it is most certainly something that improves with practice.</p>
<p>[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=&#8221;1_1&#8243; background_position=&#8221;left top&#8221; background_color=&#8221;&#8221; border_size=&#8221;&#8221; border_color=&#8221;&#8221; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; spacing=&#8221;yes&#8221; background_image=&#8221;&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;no-repeat&#8221; padding=&#8221;&#8221; margin_top=&#8221;0px&#8221; margin_bottom=&#8221;0px&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; id=&#8221;&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;0.3&#8243; animation_direction=&#8221;left&#8221; hide_on_mobile=&#8221;no&#8221; center_content=&#8221;no&#8221; min_height=&#8221;none&#8221;]<figure id="attachment_35159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35159" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-35159 size-full" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lensbaby-sweet-35-photo-by-Nina-Mingioni-61.jpg" alt="Lensbaby sweet 35 photo by Nina Mingioni 6" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lensbaby-sweet-35-photo-by-Nina-Mingioni-61.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lensbaby-sweet-35-photo-by-Nina-Mingioni-61-420x280.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35159" class="wp-caption-text">Sweet 35</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><em>Here are some simple tips to make manual focusing easier:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Remember which eye you focus with and adjust your diopters to that eye. Lots of people have different vision in both eyes – this difference may be subtle, and you may or may not be aware of it.  However, this slight variation will make a big difference when focusing manually, so take notice of which eye you prefer to focus with.</li>
<li>Consider a new eye cup.  Some time ago, I got a Hoodman HoodEYE cup, which is bigger than the standard eye cup that is included with cameras. It does a great job preventing stray light from entering the viewfinder and, because it is not symmetrical, it reminds me to use my left eye to focus.</li>
<li>Many photographers prefer to use Liveview and zoom in when focusing with the Lensbaby lenses. While this is not my preferred method, I have certainly used it more than once. When previewing your scene on the LCD in Liveview, the brightness of this image is determined by your camera (this is called “Exposure simulation”). If your LCD image appears too dark when you are using Liveview, you will have to disable exposure simulation under your menu options to get a nice, bright image.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4>
<p>This part is obvious, right? Very few photographers, even if quite experienced, make amazing Lensbaby images straight out of the box. When I got my Sweet 35 optic, I loved it right away. However, my Edge 80 took some time getting used to: to be exact, a month of shooting exclusively with the Edge 80! Ultimately, it was worth it, and the Edge 80 is my favorite optic of the two.  You will make some great images by accident in the beginning, but the real skill that comes with practice is making a Lensbaby image that truly matches your vision.</p>

<p>My final – and perhaps most valuable- tip is this: don’t practice on uncooperative models. Just don’t do it! You will hate your Lensbaby, your children, or both! Start off with inanimate subjects or (willing) adult models.</p>

<p>With my origins as a landscape photographer, I still make the time to travel to the West Coast at least once a year for some artistic adventures.  Some of my favorite settings have been Antelope Canyon and <a href="http://horseshoebend.com/" target="_blank">Horseshoe Bend</a> in Arizona.  This year, I decided to do something different.  I wanted to combine my love of landscape photography with my passion for maternity portraiture.</p>
<p>I chose the location of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/deva/photosmultimedia/Badwater-Basin.htm" target="_blank">Badwater Basin</a>, because the harsh textures and vast expanses of salt flats would be the perfect juxtaposition with the gorgeous curves of pregnancy.  Not to mention, no portraiture had been done there before.  Hmmmm, I wonder why no one else thought of finding a Mommy-to-be willing to trek all the way out to a remote area in the middle of nowhere, literally called Death Valley, likely without any cell phone reception, as the sun goes down… Not to mention, the lowest and driest area in the country, and the hottest place in the world!!  Not exactly a casting call that will have pregnant women lining up around the block.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-32705 aligncenter" src="http://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Death-Valley-sea-level-sign-640x426.jpg" alt="Death Valley sea level sign" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Death-Valley-sea-level-sign-640x426.jpg 640w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Death-Valley-sea-level-sign-310x206.jpg 310w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Death-Valley-sea-level-sign-700x466.jpg 700w, https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Death-Valley-sea-level-sign.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Thankfully we have an incredible network of fellow photographers, and I was able to find the absolute perfect model.   Christina was tall and lanky, with gorgeous red hair, and imagine my delight to find out that she’d been a high fashion model in her previous life (She’s currently busy being a mother to two little cuties, and photographer extraordinaire.)!  We had the most stunning chiffon maternity gown made by one of our favorite vendors, and it was ON.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the day of our big adventure.  My wife Sophie and I spent the morning picking up lighting gear from a local rental shop.   Followed by a quick trip to Whole Foods to stock up on snacks for the day, since there’s nothing worse than trying to get the creative juices flowing with the distraction of a grumbling belly.  We’d wanted to pick up a leaf blower to add some motion to the dress, but realized too late that we would have had to charge it the previous night.   As much as you plan, there will always be hiccups along the way.  That’s what keeps these adventures exciting.</p>
<p>The drive through Death Valley was breathtaking.  When we finally arrived at Badwater Basin, I must say we were somewhat disappointed.  There must have been a recent rainfall, because the flats were a muddy brown, and the formations were all dried up and cracked.  With my extensive research, I hadn’t even realized this could happen!  After walking around for an hour, I finally found a small area of perfect formations.  From the right angle, I could hopefully make it work.  By this time, we had just an hour till sunset.  I rushed to the car to get the lighting gear and set everything up, as Christina changed into her gown.</p>

<p>As a family photographer, it&#8217;s not often that I use a tripod or graduated filters. It&#8217;s also uncommon for me to use an ultra wide-angle lens (like the 14-24mm), nor do I recall EVER taking a portrait with my aperture down to f/16. Crazy, right? Although it took more gear than usual to capture my vision, I loved the unique experience of fusing my passion for landscapes and portraiture.</p>
<p>In the first three images, the sun is just about to set, and it&#8217;s light really defines the salt formations on the dry lake floor. The first two shots were taken with a D800 with 14-24mm. Due to the obvious wide-angle distortion of this focal length, I tried to keep the subject close to center to minimize the effects.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, we were blessed with some clouds, so I composed the shot with a bit more sky. However, the missing sun caused the salt formations to be rendered flat and featureless. Here the strobes provided much needed illumination.  One reflected off a white umbrella provided the key light (camera left), the other was shot through a honeycomb grid and provided our hair/rim light (camera right).</p>

<p>Another twenty minutes later, I decide to use a telephoto. I am always amazed at the difference in perspective that a simple focal-length change can do. D4 with the 105mm f/2 DC. The sky behind the mountains was still pinkish, but the rest of it was deep blue. I had to tune my white balance in post to 25,000 Kelvin in order to render her skin tone nice and warm. Crazy! The 105mm brought the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamint_Range" target="_blank">Panamint Mountain Range</a> so much closer. That’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope_Peak" target="_blank">Telescope Peak</a> to the left, blanketed in snow.  Luckily the valley floor was much warmer, although I must say that the salt formations are razor sharp and not as soft as they may look!</p>

<p>Badwater is such an odd place. You&#8217;re standing at a dry lake, 282 feet below sea level, while out in the distance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney" target="_blank">Mt. Whitney</a> soars at 14,505 feet high. The lowest and highest points in the country.  Talk about extremes. But we didn&#8217;t pick this location because it would be easy.  What&#8217;s the fun in that?!</p>
<p>Equipment used: Nikon D4/D800 bodies, 14-24mm f/2.8G, 105mm f/2DC, 200mm f/2, Gitzo Tripod, Lee Filters, and Profoto B1 strobes.</p>

			<p>I had the opportunity to shoot with a pre-production model of the Profoto B1, a new cordless, battery-powered off camera flash from Profoto.</p>
<p>There is a lot to get excited about when looking at this new light, and I had a few weeks to put it through its paces in some complex situations.</p>
<p>The B1 is a new off camera flash from B1, and there are a few things that set it apart from the competition.</p>
<p>Why would you choose to work with a light like the B1 rather than a simple speed light off camera? The B1 offers a superior communication system between camera and light (the Air remote&#8211; currently only available for Canon systems but soon to be available for Nikon as well), but it also offers you a few other things that make it an easy system to love.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at a few of things that set the B1 apart.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>1. Power</h2>
<p>The B1 packs the same punch as several speedlights linked together, all in one portable piece of equipment. That means that you can use the B1 to balance subjects standing in dark areas with very bright ambient light.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following image of Jackson in the cave on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard&#8211; I was able to light Jackson properly without sacrificing the gorgeous (and bright) ambient light behind him. This would have required several speedlights to accomplish the same thing, but it was so easy to put the B1 in a 4&#8242; x 6&#8242; softbox and shoot away!</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>2. TTL</h2>
<p>TTL capability is one of the things that sets the B1 apart, and coupled with the Air Remote the TTL just works. I don&#8217;t use TTL often in my work (I prefer using my flashes on manual), but I have to admit that it was fun testing TTL on the B1&#8211; I used it in some very complex situations and it performed well!</p>
<p>In the shot below at the Roman ruins in Luxembourg, I was able to use the B1 to backlight the model and illuminate the passageway behind her using TTL. I</p>
<p>f you find that the TTL is off or it needs to be tweaked, you can take the B1 to manual mode with a simple press of a button and then modify your settings from there.</p>

			<h2>3. Easy integration with Profoto Light Shapers</h2>
<p>Unlike when you use a speedlight off camera and you have to use attachments to connect the flash to the stand and the modifier to the flash, Profoto modifiers clip onto the B1 with ease.</p>
<p>You can add a beauty dish or an umbrella in just a few seconds&#8211; Profoto designed the B1 with ease of use in mind, and I was so happy to be able to switch my modifiers quickly and efficiently on the shoot.</p>
<p>In the image under the dock, I was able to switch from an umbrella to a beauty dish without fooling with the light or attachments&#8211; everything just works well! Profoto also makes some of the best modifiers in the business, so the ability to snap them on and off of the frame of the B1 with ease was a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>Traditionally one of the drawbacks of working with a light as big and as powerful as the B1 is the heavy battery pack (or access to an outlet) that you need. The B1 works with a cordless, rechargeable battery that will take you through several hours of shooting.</p>

			<p>I was so impressed with the Profoto B1. I had a very tough time giving it back to Profoto and I simply can&#8217;t wait to get one of my own!</p>
<p>This is a piece of equipment that is so versatile &#8211; whether you need a portable speedlight or a powerful studio light, a manual light or one that is TTL capable, the B1 can handle any situation that you throw at it!</p>
