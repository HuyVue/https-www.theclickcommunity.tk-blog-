Take your maximum brightness up from 1600 lumens to 4300 lumens with the C1 Plus ($499).</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Be sure to read the single one-star review before giving it too much weight; that customer has not even used the light (we have!). </em></p>

			<h2>Vivian Maier: The Color Work</h2>
<p><em>$40.99</em></p>
<p>The first definitive monograph of color photographs by American street photographer Vivian Maier, this definitive volume includes more than 150 color photographs, most of which have never been published in book form. It sheds light on the nature of Maier’s color images, examining them within the context of her black-and-white work as well as the images of street photographers with whom she clearly had kinship, like Eugène Atget and Lee Friedlander.</p>

			<p>I am so glad we live during a time when our cameras are no longer limited to capturing shades of black and white. I love color and love that we can capture a full range of hues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But as the saying goes, with this privilege comes great responsibility. When we use color intentionally, it can have a dramatic impact on what we are trying to communicate in our artwork.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The intense reds and golds of the setting sun. The subtle blues and grays in your baby&#8217;s eyes. The world is full of color. We photographers must hone our ability to notice it. And when we successfully capture the beauty of the colors we&#8217;ve observed, we can use the tools that we have to enhance and perfect the image what we created.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lightroom&#8217;s HSL panel is one of these tools. It will allow you to enhance the tones that you want to emphasize and draw your viewer into the details you love. Today I am sharing how to use it with intention for the best results.</p>
<h2>Get your color right in-camera</h2>
<p>Before we get to the editing, let&#8217;s consider how to create the best tones in-camera. Think of editing as a way to enhance what is already good in the photo rather than a means of correcting what is wrong. We should aim for intentionality in our images.</p>
<p>Not only should we learn to see the <i>quality</i> of light—its harshness, its brightness, its direction—but we should also be aware of the <i>color</i> of the light around us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed the blue tones that are present in shadows at dusk? How the midday sun produces white, yellowish light with a little green from nearby trees? Pay special attention to the light falling on your subject&#8217;s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Also watch out for colored objects that reflect light and create color casts. Is the brick wall reflecting orange-brown colors onto the subject? These subtle details will all affect your final image, so make sure they are working for you and not against you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<p>As we all know, rules are made to be broken (maybe all of us artists are really two-year-olds at heart!). In the image above the colors on the wall are throwing some warmth and yellow onto my subject&#8217;s face. I think it adds some visual interest and I happen to like the subtle tones it creates. Other photographers might choose to edit this out, but either way, this is the kind of detail we should learn to notice.</p>
<h2>Understand color theory</h2>
<p>To enhance your color awareness when shooting you should definitely take the time to learn color theory. A color wheel is a tool that can help you see how the different colors relate to each other.</p>
<p>Juxtaposing colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel will have a quite dramatic effect on an image. In photo below, the opposites of green and red/pink allow the subjects to pop from the background.</p>

			<p>In contrast, using colors that are next to each other on the color wheel emphasize the harmony of the world. Think of the greens and blues on a breezy summer day, or the reds and oranges of the trees in autumn.</p>
<h2>Relate colors to emotions</h2>
<p>Each of these examples produces a different aesthetic and emotional response based on the most prominent colors. Blues and other cool tones produce a calm, relaxing effect, while reds and warm colors are energizing.</p>
<p>When cool and warm tones mix, the effect is eye-catching. In this photo, the red on the child&#8217;s hat pops out amidst the very cool tones on the cold winter day.</p>

			<p>Color has a powerful effect on our minds, and we can use it to our advantage in our photography.</p>
<h2>The HSL panel</h2>
<p>Luckily for us, we can use editing to experiment with the colors that are already present in a photo. Unlike the sliders in the Basic panel, like saturation and temperature, the sliders in Lightroom&#8217;s HSL panel will let us alter <i>individual</i> colors in a photo.</p>
<p><i>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and luminance. </i></p>
<p>The <i>hue</i> sliders let you alter the colors themselves. Each slider allows you to influence a color toward one of the colors next to it on the color wheel. For example, you can shift the green tones in an image toward either yellow or blue. Or you could shift the purples to either blue or red.</p>
<p>This is my special trick for making a summer day look like fall. By sliding greens toward yellow and the yellow towards red, you can add warmth to the greens in leaves and grass.</p>

			<p>The <i>saturation </i>sliders allow you to adjust intensity of an individual color. A possible use for this would be to adjust the saturation of the background without affecting the skin tones. As always with saturation, be careful not to overdo it! A general rule of thumb is to keep the changes you make as subtle as possible.</p>
<p>The <i>luminance </i>sliders allow you to adjust the brightness of a color. Darkening a color can make it richer whereas brightening it can make it more subtle.</p>
<p>This tool might be helpful is to darken the blues in the sky on a bright day. Or you could brighten the skin tones to draw more attention to the subject without brightening the rest of the image.</p>
<p>So maybe you are looking at a specific part of your image, like the skin tones. How do you know which color(s) to change? Skin tones are usually a combination of multiple colors.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the developers of Lightroom foresaw this difficulty. The little circle on the top left corner of each section of the panel is a tool specifically to help with that. Just click the circle and select the part of the image with the color you want to adjust, then drag up or down. You can watch the colors sliding either left or right in the panel.</p>
<p>Especially when there are people in your photo, be aware of the effect your changes have on the skin tones. For example, shifting the yellows toward orange can make leaves look stunning and vibrant, but could also make your subject look like a pumpkin!</p>

			<h2>Have fun and experiment</h2>
<p>Now that you are equipped with the basics of how the HSL tool functions, take what you&#8217;ve learned and apply it to your photography! Experimenting will be your best aid in learning how the tool works. Maybe you&#8217;ll even learn something about your personal style, or will be inspired to try something different from your normal editing process.</p>
<p>Mastering the HSL tool has another benefit for those who have used presets. The creators of presets often use the HSL tool to get a specific look. Now you can knowledgeably tweak the sliders to make the presets work for the specific look <i>you</i> want to see in your photos</p>
<p>There are so many ways to enhance and alter color in Lightroom, and the HSL panel is just one of those ways.</p>

			<p>Chances are that if you are a photographer, you consider yourself to be at least a somewhat creative person. You likely appreciate the process of dreaming-up the perfect photo. You enjoy the activity of creating an image. And you feel energized by the finished product when it meets your vision.</p>

			<h2>Switch up your routine</h2>
<p>Too often we get stuck in the rut of sameness. We take the same routes to work. We check the same items off of our to-do lists. The same sights, locations, and people meet us as we move about our days.</p>
<p>While there can be comfort in routine, this kind of monotony can zap creativity. That’s why it is important to be intentional in changing things up from time to time.</p>
<p>Changes to the routine don’t have to be drastic. Instead, consider small ways to vary the same activities you engage in daily.</p>
<p>Do you spend the morning driving the kids to their school one mile away? Maybe one day everyone can walk or ride bikes instead. Instead of the same treadmill routine try a class at the gym. Give the farmer’s market a go instead of the usual grocery store routine. Take a walk after dinner or work from a coffee shop instead of the home office.</p>
<p>These simple acts of change can help you feel inspired. You will find yourself seeing new surroundings or everyday places in a new light.</p>

			<h2>Photograph something familiar in a new way</h2>
<p>It is said that the best photographs are the ones created by photographers who repeatedly visit the same locations. By revisiting the same spots, you can learn the behaviors of the environment, the lighting, and the atmosphere at various times of day.</p>
<p>You will find yourself noticing subtle textures and patterns in a subject and how to use those to highlight that subject in a more powerful way. You will also give yourself the opportunity to vary your images so that the same places and subjects feel fresh with each frame.</p>
<p>Consider the things that you regularly photograph. Think of fresh ways that you can approach these familiar subjects. Perhaps changing your lens will add the variety you are looking for. Maybe it’s changing your camera settings to shoot stopped down or with some motion blur will spark creativity. You can vary your perspective by photographing your familiar subjects from new angles.</p>
<p>Make mental notes as you change each of your habits. You might be surprised by how much you like what you create when you change things up!</p>

			<h2>Try a new hobby</h2>
<p>Creativity breeds creativity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you are feeling inspired in one hobby, you can often light a spark of inspiration in your other creative pursuits.</p>
<p>Since undertaking photography seriously, I have also taken classes in cake decorating, knitting, creative writing, and calligraphy. I took up home brewing, learned to garden, and became a birdwatcher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve studied weather, tide patterns, and the behavior of animals. I’ve decorated and redecorated, learned to install hardwood flooring and backsplash tiling.</p>
<p>While each of these might not directly influence my photography, they are a way of growing and maintaining creativity. These pursuits, while they might not be personal passions like photography is, ignite the artistic side of my mind.</p>
<p>Consider a hobby outside of photography and take the time to entertain it. You will undoubtedly find it inspiring you in your photography and beyond.</p>

			<h2>Go outside</h2>
<p>A few years ago, there was a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051474">study</a> I found to be so fascinating. It indicated that immersion in nature and disconnecting from technology increases an individual’s ability to perform problem-solving tasks.</p>
<p>Previous studies have also shown that exposure to nature helps with attention related disorders, increasing an individual’s ability to concentrate. Similar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vRMRBxvtZA">research</a> has also shown that spending time in nature increases creative thinking. A simple 25 minute walk through a park is enough time to allow your brain time to rest and increase your cognitive functioning!</p>
<p>Regardless of the research, I know that I feel recharged and revitalized after spending time in nature. I become more observant, more focused on what is right in front of me, and less distracted by technology and personal worries.</p>
<p>Whether you take a weekend camping trip or just a walk through the neighborhood, taking the time to observe nature is proven to leave you feeling more creative.</p>

			<h2>Play tourist/take a field trip</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that taking a vacation leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Visiting new places and having new experiences brings a wealth of shooting opportunities.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar sights and sounds of new cultures are sure to spark creativity and so I recommend packing your bags every chance you get! That said, taking a big trip isn’t always a possibility.</p>
<p>However, it <i>is</i> possible to find new experiences close to home. Ask yourself “if someone were coming to visit, where would I recommend they go?”</p>
<p>Research historical landmarks, museums, state and city parks, and other tourist spots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Check your local events calendar for upcoming exhibits, parades, and festivals. Take a day to explore a nearby town, try a new restaurant, and see your world like a tourist.</p>

<p>We are blessed to be constantly connected. Social media offers so much possibility for bringing people together. I find that using these online tools has greatly improved my day-to-day life as I use it to socialize with those I might not be able to see as often otherwise.</p>
<p>I have met and formed some of my best friendships through online forums, Instagram, and Facebook groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were brought together online through our shared love of photography and my photography friends leave me feeling inspired, motivated, and confident.</p>

			<p>When I am struggling to find inspiration, working through a slump, or trying to move past creative insecurities, I always turn to a friend. I chat through the things that are weighing on my shoulders and it relieves a bit of the burden.</p>
<p>If connecting online isn’t the best option for you, reach out to a friend who also lives a creative life and get together for coffee. Consider joining a local photography meet-up group or club. The key is to connect with other creatives who understand the process and can support you best.</p>

			<h2>Move your body</h2>
<p>Exercise is one of the best things that you can do to improve your health, both physically and mentally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Physical movement causes the body to release endorphins which lead to feelings of happiness and overall well-being.</p>
<p>Studies have found that exercise also encourages the growth of new cells in the hippocampus, the area of the brain which contributes to long-term memory and creativity.</p>
<p>It can be a brisk walk, a yoga class, or some heavy lifting at the CrossFit gym. Find the physical activity that you enjoy so that you are motivated to do it often rather than adding it to a list of chores. The benefits will impact you creatively and beyond.</p>

<p>And because we love it so much, I have taken extra care to document our Halloween costumes over the years.

			<h2>Get your shot well before Halloween</h2>
<p>I learned this lesson the hard way. If you wait until October 31 to take your portraits, you are going to be the villain that kept your kids from trick-or-treating while you played with your camera settings and backdrops and lights.</p>
<p>No one wants to delay CANDY on Halloween!</p>
<p>That’s why I usually start planning Halloween costumes far in advance of the actual day. Everything is ready to go in September and then I can take portraits weeks ahead of Halloween and post them on social media on the 31st.</p>
<p>This means that I have several weeks to take the kids’ portraits. No rushing, no stressing, and I get to be the fun mom who let’s them wear a costume on a day that isn’t Halloween!</p>

			<h2>Consider a theme</h2>
<p>We are a family of 7 which means that there is never going to be a year where all of us want to be the same thing for Halloween. One year the five-year-old is going to want to be a Transformer and the ten-year-old is going to want to be a wolf and I am going to want to be Bride of Frankenstein.</p>
<p>However, if I come-up with a theme and let everyone choose a costume that fits within it, our portraits are more cohesive. I have a set of images that go together and each member of the family still gets to choose what they want to be within that theme.</p>
<p>The key here is to keep it relatively vague. Over the years we have been “Villains and Heroes,” “Storybook Characters,” and “Monsters.” These allow the kids to have some fun choosing who they will be, putting their own stamp on the final costume while still being tied to the rest of the family.</p>

			<h2>Make the costume good</h2>
<p>I am not saying that you need to bring out your sewing machine and labor over detailed patterns. But I promise that you are going to be disappointed if you have an ill-fitting costume with the velcro closures showing in your portraits.</p>
<p>So when you go to dress-up for Halloween, find costumes that are good. Make sure they fit, add some more expensive elements to cheap costumes, and hide unsightly, inauthentic components with strategic posing or other costume elements.</p>
<p>For my Wonder Woman above, many of the accessories were metallic fabric instead of the gold that Wonder Woman herself would wear. Swapping these out for hard metallic plastic pieces made a huge difference in the believability of the final portrait.</p>

			<h2>Practice your make-up skills</h2>
<p>Having great make-up can make all the difference in transforming from the everyday version of yourself to an entirely new character. Anything from a simple contour to a full face of latex can be necessary to brush-up on your brush skills.</p>
<p>I scoured the internet for tutorials on how to transform myself into Cruella Devil. Who knew that covering up your eyebrows was so difficult?! That said, having those high-arching black brows and that cartoonishly pointed nose (all make-up!) made all the difference in changing me from Kellie to Cruella.</p>
<p>If I have learned anything from doing Halloween make-up all these years, it’s that too much probably isn’t enough. This isn’t what you wear for your daily routine or even an event or fancy date night. This is a mask of make-up. You aren’t going to want to go to the grocery store like this but it’s going to look great in the picture…I promise!</p>

			<h2>Set the mood</h2>
<p>Anyone can wear a great costume, do great make-up, and take a quick snap shot. But the real fun lies in creating a mood around the costume that helps set the tone of the character you want to be.</p>
<p>Canned atmosphere, a fog machine, or some fog overlays can make a scene look spooky and mysterious. When you want to be a monster or a villain, this can make a huge difference in the impression your costume leaves on the viewer!</p>
<p>My favorite way to set the mood is to use light with intention. In fact, I do this even when I am not photographing Halloween costumes!</p>
<p>Think about how different kinds of light might make a character appear. Back light is dreamy and hazy. Split light is a bit more mysterious. Hard light is harsh and striking while soft light is more forgiving.</p>
<p>When I was photographing my Frankenstein’s monster (Mr. Bieser is such a trooper!) I lit him from below to mimic the light of spooky story time at elementary school sleepovers. This also created a large shadow behind him that exaggerated his size and added to his terrifying costume.</p>

			<h2>Have fun editing</h2>
<p>Halloween portraits are the perfect time to let loose a little bit with your post processing. You don’t have to create realistic scenes here. In fact, the point is to emphasize fantasy!</p>
<p>This means that you can have a lot of fun to help turn your subject into their character. Change colors, add weather, transform their shape…there is no limit to what you can do here!</p>
<p>When I was photographing my little Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, I just loved her pigtail braids and her skipping along the path and her blue gingham dress. She was embodying Dorothy perfectly!</p>
<p>And yet, I couldn’t help but think that the scene needed just a little more magic. So, I started to play in Photoshop. A little rainbow overlay added the perfect bit of wonder to the scene and while not realistic, changes this shot from “Annie in a Dorothy costume” to “Dorothy is here!”</p>

			<h2>Don’t take any of this too seriously</h2>
<p>Obviously I am a huge fan of Halloween, but I urge you to keep the spirit of the day in mind as you photograph your family costumes. This is supposed to be fun. You aren’t supposed to turn into an actual monster as you go about documenting your costumes.</p>
<p>Instead, look at this as an opportunity to be creative and try new things. It’s a chance to get the whole family involved in the picture-making process.</p>
<p>So let loose, have a blast, and laugh a lot as you transform into your characters. Taking photos is all about capturing memories and I want these to be some of your best.</p>

			<p>Photography is a creative outlet. It should feel truly enjoyable and rewarding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there are parts of this process that aren’t as fulfilling. They are necessary and worth the effort. Yet if they take too much time, these tasks can diminish the enjoyment we find in our photography. They can squash our creative motivation and make it more difficult for us to connect with our voice and vision.</p>
<p>To protect yourself from creative exhaustion, I am a big fan of speeding-up the processes that don’t feed your creativity. For me and so many photographers, that’s editing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>Get it right in camera</h2>
<p>This is the most effective way to save your time in post-processing. By getting your exposure right, choosing the best possible crop, dialing-in white balance, and making great choices <i>before</i> you hit the shutter button, you save yourself the time and effort of fixing these little things in Lightroom or Photoshop.</p>
<p>Look at the back of your camera and your histogram to ensure that the light is just how you want it. Watch for distracting elements in the background so that you don’t have to clone them out later. Be careful not to crop out any important components of the frame. All of these <i>can</i> be fixed in post processing, but are the kinds of mundane tasks that can quickly zap creativity.</p>
<p>Make smart, intentional choices on location to get the shots that perfectly match your vision. Don’t depend upon your editing do match the mood you want to achieve. Instead, allow it to enhance what you have captured in camera. Make editing a seamless part of the process rather than a stressful, time-consuming task to “fix” everything.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right moment</h2>
<p>It can be tempting to fire away with a digital camera. I mean, if you take a shot you don’t like you can just delete it, right?!</p>
<p>However, sifting through 500 photos of the same scene to find the one that is best is a really time-consuming task! It can be exhausting spending all that time comparing and contrasting too many nearly identical photos.</p>
<p>Instead, take your time and choose the moments you want to capture. Set your focus. Check your composition. And only hit that shutter button when you have the shot that you know you will love.</p>
<p>Of course, with fast-moving subjects you might want to take more than one photo and that’s okay! However, there is a big difference between taking an “insurance” shot and shooting indiscriminately. Be the kind of photographer who takes the former approach and you will save a ton of time in the culling process.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right time to edit</h2>
<p>If you feel like you are too emotionally invested in the session to make wise decisions immediately after the session, take a day or two off before working your way through the photos. You will have fresh eyes and won’t feel any of the nerves or frustrations that you may have experienced while shooting. Similarly, take breaks from editing as needed to keep your eyes and mind fresh and inspired.</p>
<p>The time of day that you choose to edit can make a big difference as well! Are you a morning person who feels motivated as soon as you wake-up? Then that might be the best time for you to sit in front of the computer and work through a session efficiently. Are your kids off at school during the day? Then perhaps that is the best time for you to edit as you can do so without interruptions.</p>
<p>I like to edit toward the end of the day when I have more energy and the darker conditions let me see all of my adjustments more clearly. The key is to find the time of day where you can work logically and efficiently to maximize your time and productivity.</p>

			<h2>Cull backwards</h2>
<p>Chance are, your subject is going to be most relaxed at the end of the session with more natural body language and expressions.</p>
<p>If you are taking advantage of golden hour? Your light is going to be it’s most gorgeous as the sun edges closer and closer to the horizon line.</p>
<p>I often stop shooting when I know that I got the moment just right.</p>
<p>All of this to say that there is a good chance that your best photos are going to be some of the last on your memory card. That’s why I like to cull through my images backwards, starting with those last photos from the session and working my way to the first photos.</p>
<p>Photomechanic is a great tool that I use to move through the photos quickly. It streamlines the process of organizing them, moving them into different folders, and opening them in the editing software of your choice.</p>

<p>When you have a set of images that are from the same session, in the same location, and in the same light, you are going to want them to look cohesive. That’s why synchronizing your editing workflow can be so helpful!</p>
<p>Instead of processing each photo individually, create your own actions and/or presets that you can adjust and apply those to your photos in batch edits. This will allow you to go through each image and tweak things so that everything is perfect while saving you a ton of time in the end.</p>

<p>When you are working through your post-session routine, let go of the idea that every photo should be perfect. Instead, polish every photo to be its best and then move on. You could sit forever trying to edit away every little flaw and eventually, you will burn out.</p>
<p>Embrace the fact that no one is perfect 100% of the time. Instead, find all the moments and emotions you captured and know that your clients will love them because of the memories attached to those photos.</p>

			<h2>Change the way you view editing</h2>
<p>So many photographers talk about editing as if it is a big, looming chore at the end of the photographic process. Being behind the camera is so much more fun! This makes being motivated to work on photos a process that is dreaded and avoided and often drawn-out.</p>
<p>However, if you change the way you look at editing, it may become something that you look forward to! It will become easier to work through your sessions in a timely manner, opening your schedule to the space and time you need to stay creatively motivated and inspired.</p>

			<p>There are lots of sweet milestones in a child’s lifetime. First steps. First words. The first day of school.</p>
<p>And in the our household, one of the big milestones is our kids’ first time up to bat. We are a baseball family through and through and when one of our kids gets to put on little cleats and have a helmet wobbling on their heads as they trot up to the tee, it’s a major event.</p>
<p>Sports are a big part of so many kids’ memories. The competition and camaraderie are transformative and can help shape the kinds of people they become.</p>
<p>As a mother, I find documenting my kids’ experiences in sports to be incredibly rewarding. Not only am I capturing them in their element doing activities they enjoy, but I am also capturing the process of them learning lifelong lessons. And it doesn’t hurt that they are usually way more excited about me taking these photos than they are about more formal portraits!</p>
<p>All that said, there are a lot of things to consider when photographing kids playing sports. Over the years I have learned some good lessons and today, I am here to share all of them with you.</p>

			<h2>Bring the right lens</h2>
<p>I am a big fan of making the gear I have on me work. It’s the photographer who takes the picture, not the camera, right?!</p>
<p>But in a special situation like a sporting event, having the right camera and lenses can make all the difference in getting *the* shot or missing it altogether.</p>
<p>You are likely going to want to use a telephoto lens (unless your kid doesn’t mind you laying in the middle of the field during the game…and I promise you that she minds!). A <a href="https://amzn.to/2NSlxeF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70-200mm</a> is a great versatile focal length that will serve you well on and off the field. You will likely still have to crop in from time to time as those fields get bigger as the kids get older but it’s a great place to start.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on all the action, consider renting a super telephoto lens (I love the <a href="https://amzn.to/2A52e9V" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">200-500mm zoom</a>) for a special game and feel like you are a Sports Illustrated photographer for the day.</p>
<p>The key is to have something that allows you to zoom in beyond what your naked eye sees. This will keep you out of the way but make it feel like you were right there.</p>

			<h2>Choose the right settings</h2>
<p>In most cases, your kids are going to be moving quite a bit when they are playing a sport. This means that in order to freeze the action you are going to want to have a fast shutter speed. This means that every time you hit the shutter button, the shutter is opening and closing super fast to ensure that only one part of your athlete’s movement is captured in the photograph.</p>
<p>For game time, I like to keep my shutter speed as fast as possible. My camera goes up to 1/8000 second and if I can stay there, I will! If the light situation makes that impossible, I will adjust my ISO and aperture settings so that I can stay above 1/1250 at the very least. This ensures that I don’t have any motion blur in my photos and I get that frozen action that looks so great in sports photography.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is your white balance. While it’s not as much of a concern on the baseball field where we are outside, indoor sports like basketball and volleyball have much trickier light situations where correct white balance can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Be sure to dial in your settings to correct for any strange color casts that might be coming from fluorescent lights. You might have some color casts to edit out from green grass or yellow wood flooring, so keep an eye on those things when you have your photos in your post processing program of choice.</p>

			<h2>Get the in between moments</h2>
<p>While the action shots are definitely awesome, I find that the photos that most often pull at my heart are the ones of the in between moments. My camera is always seeking a furrowed brow watching the action, a big gulp of water, or a simple moment taking a break from the work of running up and down the field.</p>

			<p>When photographing your kids’ playing sport, don’t forget to seek out the quieter moments. These can be filled with so much emotion and are a great way to tell the story of the whole game.</p>
<p>Scan the sidelines, be watchful during timeouts, and keep your camera ready when they’re sitting the bench. The in between moments are just as important as any touchdown or home run.</p>
<h2>Capture the details</h2>
<p>From our place on the sidelines, we see the whole game. It’s a wide angle view of the venue and allows us to appreciate all of the action happening on the court/field/arena/stadium/gym.</p>
<p>But when you are playing the game? Everything is right up close. A pitcher can feel every individual lace on the baseball. A golfer can see every dimple on the golf ball. Basketball players feel the net brush by their fingertips.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that when we are wanting to tell the story of a sport, we would want to capture the details as well as the big picture. Consider zeroing in on a foot kicking a ball or hands holding a bat. Removing everything else from the frame is a great way to draw attention to the little things that make the athletic experience so unique.</p>

			<p>I dusted off my macro converters to capture this up-close shot of my son holding a game ball. I love how you can see the individual threads in the laces and the dust from the field. And he likes the photo so much that he asked for a print for his bedroom!</p>
<h2>Include the team</h2>
<p>While I am most definitely at any game with my camera to capture my kids, it would be tragic not to get shots of the whole team. The friendships formed through playing together are a huge part of what makes sports in childhood so special.</p>

			<p>We have a team photographer who always takes a more formal photo of everyone together. However, I like to capture the more candid moments and let the kids show their personalities a bit. At the end of the season I will have prints made for everyone as a thank you for a great season.</p>
<h2>Put down the camera and cheer!</h2>
<p>As a mom-photographer, there aren’t too many things that make me happier than capturing my kids in their element. But it’s also super important to put down the camera from time to time and really watch the game.</p>

			<p>I don’t think there is a more magical fall tradition than heading to the farm to pick the perfect pumpkin. I love seeing my children’s tastes in their pumpkin of choice shift over the years. I’ve seen preferences for the tiniest of pumpkins and oddly shaped ones and some so big that they couldn’t carry them to the car.</p>

			<p>When photographing these outings, I do try to be intentional with my children’s clothing. I often find that simple is best. Since a pumpkin patch is colorful, I love to dress my children in neutral clothing that I know will photograph well.</p>
<h2>Pumpkin carving</h2>
<p>After we pick the perfect pumpkins, it is always so much fun to bring them home and transform them into our own special jack-o-lanterns. This activity is particularly beloved and photo worthy because the kids’ expressions are so darned cute!</p>
<p>My son Woody is always disgusted with the process of cleaning out the pumpkin. And yet he begs to do this every single year! It’s his expressions that make the photo. Meanwhile my son Archie’s enthusiasm for the pumpkin goop and carving creates wonderful juxtaposition.</p>

			<p>We love to go on walks, especially in autumn when the temperatures are cooler and there are no bugs! We make a game of finding every color in the rainbow as we explore. It keeps the kids engaged with what they are seeing and adds a fun bit of competition to our exploring.</p>
<p>Getting outside is also a great way to stay healthy, reset creatively, and gives me the opportunity to photograph the kids enjoying nature.</p>

			<p>Do you have a local farm within driving distance? Chances are that they have all kinds of things happening this fall for you and your family to enjoy. For me, this is one of my favorite things about autumn. Bring on the donuts and warm apple cider!</p>
<p>Hay rides are a simple, albeit bouncy, way to get everyone giggling and having fun. Like pumpkin carving, this is a great way to capture all of your children in the frame.</p>

			<p>I adore the fall season. The temperatures begin to cool. The trees begin to change their pigments for a breathtaking reveal of color. Apples and begin to ripen into warm vibrant hues. And the smell of pumpkin spice lattes fill the air!</p>
<p>Living in the northern Midwest region of the United States, I am lucky enough to view the vibrant fall foliage that blankets my area each season. I find myself prowling the back roads every late September and early October.</p>
<p>However, even with plenty of opportunities to see the leaves put on their colorful display, photographing autumn color takes some practice. Today I am sharing some of the lessons I have learned in my pursuit of capturing the hues of the season so that you can capture them in your part of the world.</p>

			<h2>Chase the color</h2>
<p>Fall color doesn’t all happen in the same place at the same time. Instead, it spreads in waves over the course of days and weeks. To capture it at its best, you might need to travel and chase it a bit.</p>
<p>Many publications in different regions will put out fall foliage forecasts. These anticipate what areas will be at peak color and at what time. Often, a state’s department of natural resources website will provide accurate and up-to-date information on the foliage color within the varying state parks. There are also apps that you can download to keep a watchful eye on color and plan your excursions.</p>
<p>With that said, it is important to see that these sources of information are updated regularly. Weather can be very unpredictable and alter the leaf color. Leaf color can go from not being quite at peak to past peak in under a week with the lightest frost!</p>
<p>Keep a close eye on your local weather forecasts as they will inform you on how the color is spreading and if any unpredictable weather is going to impact the foliage.</p>

			<h2>The best time to photograph fall color</h2>
<p>Now that you found <i>where</i> to photograph that fall color, It’s time to get your camera ready! After all of that planning, you will want to maximize your time.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you will want to shoot for as many hours a day as you can. However, I find that early morning and late evening are my favorite times to capture the season.</p>
<p>The golden hour sunlight will enhance the colors of the trees. Many mornings misty fog will greet you, adding a layer of texture and mystery to your photos.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/what-golden-hour-why-photographers-love-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Golden Hour and why do photographers love it?</a></strong></p>
<p>I also find that these times are somewhat quieter allowing for me to photograph the color without too many people to clone out of my final shots! I find these first and last moments of sunlight to be so peaceful and enjoy the relative solitude when photographing at these times.</p>

			<h2>Prepare for the weather</h2>
<p>While the best fall days are cool and crisp and lovely, the weather during peak leaf color is highly unpredictable. It’s best to be prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws your way so that you aren’t too uncomfortable as you work to capture her with your camera.</p>
<p>If it is raining, use that opportunity to grab that macro lens and capture rain drops on leaves. If an unexpected storm comes through and knocks most of the leaves off the trees, capture the leaves blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>My favorite weather to shoot in is overcast conditions or even a slight mist. It gives the color a rich saturation without glare.</p>
<p>If you are lucky to have beautiful golden hour light, wait until the light is fiery orange and pair it with the golden foliage for a more intense show of color.</p>
<p>Bring layers of clothing so that you can bundle-up if necessary. having a simple rain cover for your camera can prevent major disasters for your gear. Boots, good socks, hats, and fingerless gloves are all good items to keep close by if the weather takes a turn.</p>

			<h2>Allow yourself to be creative</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why I love fall so much is because it is so unique. It happens once a year for a short window and in only certain locations.</p>
<p>Allow this novelty to inspire your shooting! Instead of choosing your go-to lens for every shot, switch it up with something you rarely reach for. Even just using your everyday lenses in a new way can create fantastic results. Try changing your standard shutter speed and aperture settings to create something new.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to try some experimental techniques. Maybe you see one standing tree with color that still remains but all the other trees that surround it have lost their leaves. Use long exposure and try to pan your camera for a more impressionist feel to your imagery.</p>

			<p>Try different perspectives and angles. I love to shoot from above with my son as he holds his collected nature treasures or that basket of apples that was just picked. Get down low to capture the majesty of the trees in front of you.</p>
<p>You also don’t have to depend on nature to give you all the color. Incorporate fall tones through clothing and other environmental elements.</p>
<p>Being creative during this time of year breaks you of your usual habits and puts you into a more creative space for your fall photos and beyond.</p>

			<h2>Focus on the details</h2>
<p>If you just missed peak season for color or most of the leaves are on the ground, focus on interesting compositions, textures and patterns that surround you. Beautiful details can be found in your own backyard!</p>
<p>Find fall treasures like acorns, leaves, and produce and zoom in on the textures that make them special. Seeing these items in a new way can reveal an extra layer of magic of the season.</p>

			<p>As a kids and family photographer, I am not working with picture perfect models. I am photographing <em>real</em> people. People who blink from time to time. Who yawn in the middle of a shot. People who are just like me and my family.</p>
<p>And the more people I add to the frame? The more chances there are for at least one of them to be blinking/yawning/wiggling in any given photograph. If I had to scrap every photo where someone wasn&#8217;t perfect, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to deliver many to my clients!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why mastering the Photoshop head swap has been so important. This allows me to take those photos where almost everyone looks perfect and make the changes to let everyone look their best.</p>
<p>The best part is that head swaps don&#8217;t have to be difficult. With the right preparation, you can make head swaps that look convincing and don&#8217;t make you want to scream. Follow the steps below and you&#8217;ll be well on your way to making everyone look great!</p>

			<h2>Start with the right photos</h2>
<p>If you try to do a head swap with two photos from two different sessions, you are likely going to run into some issues. The white balance, the direction of the light, and the surroundings are all going to be different in those two photos. This makes it nearly impossible to put them together convincingly.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will want to start with two photos taken relatively close together. This will ensure that you have an easier time blending them together as the direction of the light and elements in the background will be mostly the same.</p>

			<h2>Do global edits before you start swapping</h2>
<p>I make big global edits to white balance, clarity, and exposure in Adobe Camera Raw. When I am planning to do a head swap, I will bring both photos into ACR simultaneously so that I can ensure that these global edits are identical.</p>
<p>This ensures that when I do the head swap the clarity, exposure, and skin tones match. If you have a slightly cooler white balance in one photo and put a warmer toned face in that picture, it will be an instant giveaway that some Photoshop shenanigans were happening&#8230;and we don&#8217;t want that!</p>

			<h2>Select the face you want to swap&#8230;and a lot more</h2>
<p>The biggest surprise for me when learning to do convincing head swaps was how little I would be working on the actual face. Instead, It&#8217;s much more about blending in the surrounding area. The goal is to incorporate the face seamlessly into the rest of the photo.</p>
<p>This means that when you are selecting the area of the &#8220;good face&#8221; that you want to copy onto the photo where everyone else looks good, you will need to select a much larger area than you might think you have to. The more surrounding area you give yourself to work with, the easier it will be to blend it in.</p>
<p>You can use the lasso tool or the rectangular marquis tool in Photoshop to select the area you want to copy. Once you have it selected, go to Edit &gt; Copy and then head over to the final photo to paste it.</p>

			<h2>Layer masks are your friend</h2>
<p>Layer masks are a large reason that I love Photoshop. They give me full control over how much and where  any of my adjustments affect my final image. And layer masks are key to performing a convincing head swap.</p>
<p>Once you have copied and pasted your selection onto the final photo, you will see that you have created a new layer. Move that layer to the general location where you will want the new face to land. I reduce the opacity of the layer here to about 50%. This way I can see through it and place the new face directly on top of the original.</p>

			<p>Here you will add a layer mask to your copied layer. You will see that the mask is completely white. This means that you can see all of what is on the layer. When the layer mask is black, you are hiding the layer.</p>
<p>To blend our new face onto the original photo, we are going to paint black onto that white layer mask. This means that we are going to hide the areas we copied that we don&#8217;t want to be in the final photo and we are going to leave the areas we want to have changed.</p>

			<h2>Work with the right brushes</h2>
<p>As you paint black onto your layer mask, you will want to have the right tool. I use the paintbrush tool at 100% opacity and 0% hardness (to start). This means that you will have a super soft edge to the brush (great for blending things together). You will be painting pure black as you start to hide the areas of the layer you do not want to see.</p>
<p>Start by removing any harsh edges from your layer. Then work your way inward to blend the background. You will want to pay careful attention to patterns and textures as these can be tricky to blend.</p>
<p>As you start to work along edges, you might need to change the hardness of your brush. Having a slightly harder brush will allow you to paint an edge so that you get it to look natural in the new background you are adding for the head swap.</p>

<p>Zoom in and out. Toggle the eyeball on your layer to observe the changes. Move between the white and black brush to reveal and conceal the layer as necessary. Take a walk away from the computer from time to time to let your eyes rest.</p>
<p>You want to be certain that you have everything just right before you move onto your final creative edits in the photo. Taking the time to get it right now will ensure that you aren&#8217;t frustrated later.</p>

			<p>I am a mom of five kids. Which means that I am a bit of an expert in wrangling groups of children.</p>
<p>But even with my experience in keeping the kids in line, photographing them can be a real challenge. They move, they wiggle, they don’t want their pictures taken, they are easily distracted. And that doesn’t even begin to cover the struggles behind the camera!</p>

			<h2>Be a little bossy</h2>
<p>The kids I photograph are not professional models. They are kids. And when I aim my big camera at them, they often don’t really know what to do.</p>
<p>A big way to help them get comfortable while also helping you get the photos you want is to tell them exactly what to do. Show them the precise spot where they should stand. Tell them to put one hand in a pocket or a hand on a hip. Have them look here, then look there, then smile, then no smile.</p>
<p>While you may feel like you are just rattling off orders, you are actually creating an environment where your kid subjects can feel confident. By giving a direction and then letting them succeed, you are showing them that they can succeed in this photo mission.</p>
<p>Even more, being a little bossy creates some boundaries that will keep your subjects engaged and (somewhat) behaved as you shoot. I love a little innocent rebelliousness in the form of giggles and tickles, but I don’t want there to be chaos in front of the camera. Being direct in what I need the kids to do makes me a (friendly) authoritative figure. It gives me the chance to control what is happening so that I can get the results that I want.</p>

			<h2>Choose your camera settings wisely</h2>
<p>There are some technical considerations to make when photographing any large group. The biggest challenge with groups of kids is ensuring that they are all in focus.</p>
<p>You will want to close down your aperture (have a larger f-stop number than you might usually have). This will give you a larger depth of field so that more people in the group will be in focus even if they are not in a perfect line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/aperture-science-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is aperture? A beginner’s guide for photographers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>You will also want to have a fast shutter speed. Even when kids are sitting still, they are wiggling. I never let my shutter speed go below 1/125 second and that’s when I have a super cooperative subject. If you are anticipating any movement that is more dynamic, you will want to make that shutter speed faster. I like to stay at 1/800 for walking, and even faster if I am wanting to capture jumping, running, skipping, or twirling.</p>
<p>As such, I am always willing to sacrifice ISO or add some extra light to accommodate these settings. Proper exposure and focus are possible with a group of kids, but you have to plan for it!</p>

			<h2>Be playful</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, there was nothing worse than being prepped for a boring activity where I had to behave myself. Sitting for forever while the adults drone on about adult things and having to just sit still and follow orders is the worst!</p>
<p>So if you want a group of kids to be on board for a photo session, you aren’t going to want to make it a chore. Instead, make it a game!</p>
<p>If you want everyone to be sitting still, have a contest to see who can keep their feet glued to the spot longest. If you are like me and love a lot of movement in your shot, have a race or see who can jump the highest. Even a simple prompt like, “Everyone look at the kid who is most likely to toot at the dinner table!” can turn boring picture day into a fun/funny event.</p>
<p>Having a playful personality yourself and making it so that the kids can be in their natural state of play. And when your subjects are in their natural state, you are going to have happy, relaxed subjects who will give you the shots you want.</p>

			<h2>Know the dynamics</h2>
<p>Every group has its own interpersonal dynamics. You will want to take the time to ask about and observe the dynamics in the group of kids you are photographing. This ensures that you are working with your subjects rather than against them.</p>
<p>In my own family, I know that if I put the nine-year-old next to the twelve-year-old, I am asking for trouble. However, if I put the fifteen-year-old next to the four-year-old I have a match made in heaven. When I am placing all my kids in their spots for a photo, I know that if I don’t keep these dynamics in mind that I will have a much harder time getting everyone to cooperate for the shot.</p>
<p>When photographing kids with whom you are not as familiar, you will want to be sure that you are watching for cues to see who gets along and who doesn’t as much. Ask mom and dad who plays together the most. Observe who naturally gravitates toward each other as you work through a session. Be on the lookout for any bickering, pestering, or side eyeing.</p>
<p>And as much as this is for you to be able to navigate setting up the photo with ease, this is also about capturing the kids as they really are. If there are certain kids within the group who are more likely to be together than others, it makes sense to show that in your photos! Embrace this as an opportunity to illustrate the kids as they are rather than as a hurtle to overcome.</p>

			<h2>Get comfortable with the head swap</h2>
<p>With any group of people, you are going to have that one perfect shot. Everyone is smiling and happy. The posing is perfect. The light is gorgeous.</p>
<p>And then there is that one guy who has his eyes closed!</p>
<p>This is just the nature of adding more variables to the situation. The more people you add, the less likely it is that you will get everyone picture-perfect in the same shot.<br />
Luckily, we photographers have a little magic on our side called Photoshop. While editing can seem overwhelming and scary at times, there are some tricks that are absolute lifesavers when photographing groups of kids. The head swap is for sure one of these tricks.</p>
<p>This just means that you take a face from one photo in a similar setting and light situation and place it onto another photo where the other people in the frame look their best. The trick is to blend it into the photo (using layer masks and super soft brushes) so that no one can tell that it wasn’t perfect from the start. Like a lot of things in photography, it takes practice…but it’s a skill worth practicing!</p>

			<h2>Embrace imperfection</h2>
<p>With social media showing us “perfect” images all the time, it’s easy to think that our less-than-perfect photos aren’t worthy. And chances are, when you have a group of kids in the frame, “perfection” is going to be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>But the truth is, perfection is a myth. And if you ask me, one of the things that makes kids great is their carefree nature. They don’t feel the pressure to be perfect. They just are. That in and of itself is pretty perfect.</p>
<p>So when photographing a group of kids, let go of the idea of perfection and allow your subjects to be who they are. Don’t judge the final shots by how perfect everyone looks and instead seek out the moments and expressions that speak to the moment. These are the photos that really matter and when you embrace them, you will find yourself so much more motivated to reach for your camera.</p>
