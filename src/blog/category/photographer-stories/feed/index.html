Ashley’s work is insanely unique and long before its time. Her images will take you back in time but also propel you forward into this space that you didn’t know existed. Her use of color, patterns, texture and of the box shots makes each image feels like a glimpse into a secret world.

			<p>I always had an interest in photography. I remember borrowing my dad’s camera from time to time as a teen. Rolls of film would be used to capture landscapes and my own family whenever I could get my hands on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All I knew back then was to simply click the shutter and hope that I got something good. Then school, college, and grad school happened. And all that photography passion went to the sidelines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

			<h2>A rough start</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2012, about six months after my son was born, when I bought my first DSLR camera. It was a Canon T3 Rebel. I was so proud of taking that first step of owning something that was mine.</p>
<p>At that time, all I could think to myself was, “I have a fancy DSLR now and I spent good money on it. I should be able to take great photos!” I had no idea how much learning and practice was required to actually implement and start taking semi decent photographs of my family!</p>
<p>My DSLR was there as I took many photos of my little boy as he grew. But those pictures were mostly snapshots (and a bit cringe-worthy when I look back at them now!)</p>
<p>Even though I had the best intentions to learn it all, I had no idea what I was doing. I watched many YouTube videos trying to self learn while juggling a full time job and a newborn. I found myself perpetually frustrated. The thought that I would never be good enough to do this started to creep in.</p>
<p>As a last feeble attempt, I enrolled myself in an in-person camera class. However, even that truly never worked out and I ended up more confused than before.</p>
<p>Everything seemed like ‘rocket science’ to me. Why was it so hard to understand exposure? Why were all my shots blurry? Nothing made sense! I had no friends who shared my interest in photography during those years and no mentor to ask all of the questions I had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so my DSLR just stayed in my closet collecting dust.</p>

			<h2>Education made fun</h2>
<p>In 2015, we were planning on going on a big dream vacation to Europe. I so wanted to use my big camera during our trip to document our travels. Inspired to try again to learn how to use my camera, I turned to Google. And that’s when I found <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a>.</p>
<p>The photos were beautiful and everything about it seemed so friendly and encouraging. And I could relate to this group of moms who wanted to take better photos! I decided to enroll myself then and there to learn as much as I could.</p>
<p>When I logged into the forum for the first time, I was in awe of (and a little overwhelmed by) all the information I found. Whether I wanted to learn about light or figure out why I couldn’t get things in focus, it was all right there waiting for me. The biggest challenge was finding time to read it all!</p>
<p>Even more, I found that these tutorials weren’t technical and boring. They were so friendly and fun that I looked forward to reading as many as I could I had finally found the place where I could learn how to use my camera.</p>

			<h2>Inspiration through the work of others</h2>
<p>As a mom who was mainly interested in taking photos of her child, I could not get enough of the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/18-picture-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picture share forum</a> when I first joined Clickin Moms. There was so much inspiration from other photographers and I loved to share my favorite shots alongside all of the talented artists there.</p>
<p>I would be nervous posting my images anywhere else. I was afraid of the criticism and unkind comments that can be so freely given on social media and other forums. But I knew that at Clickin Moms, the feedback would always be encouraging and helpful.</p>
<p>This kind of sharing allowed me to grow. It helped me build confidence so that I could move from okay photos to pictures of which I was truly proud. With the examples of the amazing artists at Clickin Moms, I was inspired to be the best photographer I could be.</p>

			<h2>Putting myself out there for critique</h2>
<p>Opening your work up to critique can be scary. Especially when it’s a picture of your child that you love. But at Clickin Moms, I learned to love critique as I found that it was truly the best way to learn and grow.</p>
<p>There were times when I would find myself knowing that a photo could use a little something extra. But I couldn’t put my finger on what that something extra was. That’s when I would post my work in the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/2-serious-critique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious critique forum</a>.</p>
<p>The Click Pro community and the Clickin Moms Mentors were always around to offer support and feedback on whatever I needed. The feedback was about growth and positivity rather than bringing me down.</p>
<p>Just like the kind comments in the picture shares, these more detailed critiques left me feeling like I could improve. The professionals and experienced artists at Clickin Moms made me feel like I <i>could</i> improve! They told me what I was doing right and gave me real steps to figure out how to get better. And that made all the difference in my photography journey.</p>

			<h2>Advice on business<i> </i></h2>
<p>While I bought my camera with the intention of starting a new hobby, it didn’t take long before I started to think about how this could be a business. However, there’s a lot more to starting a photography business than just taking good pictures! Clickin Moms was there to help when I was ready to take the leap from hobbyist to professional.</p>
<p>With a community made of people at all different places in their photography journeys, I was able to have input from people who had been in my shoes. I was able to learn from photographers who knew what it took to be in business and could guide me as I planned for my own.</p>
<p>This community allowed me to start my business with confidence and avoid so many of the pitfalls many photographers face as they make the move to becoming professionals.</p>

			<h2>Diversity in genres</h2>
<p>It’s true that many of the photographers who are at Clickin Moms started with photography just like I did. They bought a “fancy camera” because they wanted to take photos of their kids.</p>
<p>But there are so many other kinds of photographers at Clickin Moms, too! Whether you want to try landscapes or still life, portraits or weddings, macro or fine art, there are other photographers who are working in those genres, too, at Clickin Moms.</p>
<p>Even though I still love photographing my kids the most, this diversity has inspired me to try new things and find other genres that I enjoy. This experimenting keeps me inspired I love to see what new subjects the artists at Clickin Moms are photographing.</p>

			<h2>Real life friendships</h2>
<p>If someone told me ten years ago that real friends can be found online too, I would have laughed out loud. Yet, that’s exactly what happened!</p>
<p>Connected by our shared love of photography, it’s easy to create true friendships here. More than a few times you will see people from this virtual community traveling to meet-up or organizing get-togethers with their local members.</p>
<p>Some of the friends I have made through this community are now my lifelong friends. Our relationships extend beyond photography as we share stories of motherhood and work and life. Even our kids have become friends! How awesome is that?!</p>

			<h2>Setting goals</h2>
<p>Being a member of Clickin Moms really opened my eyes to the possibilities of what I could do with my camera. I realized that while taking better pictures of my kids was a great goal, the sky is the limit when it comes to what I can do with my camera.</p>
<p>Whatever your goals are, Clickin Moms is the place where you can set them, work toward them, and reach them with a group of artists who wants you to succeed.</p>
<p>I am honestly thankful for all my achievements and blessings that came along my way in this photography journey. To me, it’s not really just about photography anymore. It’s about something much bigger.</p>
<p>Photography is about the connections and the sense of community between women photographers all around the world. We lift one another up and encourage each other to be our best. It has changed my life for the better and I owe all of it to <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/amember/aff/go/CMblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickin Moms</a>.</p>

			<p>Photography has always been a passion of mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When I was younger, I took photography classes at the local recreation center with my dad. Every weekend we’d check out photography books from the library and pore over them together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I have always had a camera in my hand. I have strived to be the memory keeper of the family, making photo books of every vacation and trying to capture all of the important moments.</p>
<p>But as an adult, it never even occurred to me that I could pursue photography as not just a hobby but also as a career. All I knew of professional photographers were people who had gone to art school to study fashion photography. “Professional” in my mind meant elaborate studio setups and modeled shoots for magazines.</p>
<p>I figured that since I did not have a degree in photography that being a professional was out of reach. I was a full-time mom with 3 kids in tow and going back to school full time wasn’t an option.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And then a simple Google search led me to Clickin Moms. And suddenly, a whole new world opened up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In just four years, Clickin Moms has redefined for me what it means to be a photographer. These are the ways that this community has been instrumental in my own photography journey and how I see it impacting the lives of members from around the world.</p>

			<h2>A community of women</h2>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Clickin Moms is that it is a community of women. When I was hunting around for photography resources and materials, it seemed that almost everything I came across was incredibly male-dominated. Written by men, moderated by men, and from a male perspective.</p>
<p>Now, as a mother of a bunch of males, I take no issues with that perspective. But I craved resources that were created by someone with <i>me</i> in mind. From <i>my</i> point of view (or something similar). Moderated by people who understood me.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>Clickin Moms was a breath of fresh air from the first time I set virtual foot in the forum. It felt like home. It was a place that I could express myself without fear of judgement or rejection. There was comfort in a place where I knew fellow members would just get what I was saying.</p>
<p>Many of the women on the forum come from a background similar to mine. Many are mothers, and most did not go to art school or even realize that they wanted to pursue photography until well into adulthood.</p>
<p>Because we have that common ground, it is easy for us to connect with one another, to create learning resources that make sense for us, and to lift each other up.</p>

			<h2>A community of encouragers</h2>
<p>I vividly remember the very first time I posted a picture to the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/18-picture-share/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picture Share forum</a> on Clickin Moms. And I was scared out of my mind! I had seen some of the amazing work that other women on the forum created and I thought to myself, “I will never measure up to that.”</p>
<p>And you know what? Not one person ever once made me feel as if that were the case. Right away I had people reaching out to me. They commented on my picture, asked me questions about myself, and were just generally encouraging.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/16-introduce-yourself/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Are you a new Clickin Moms member? YAY! We can&#8217;t wait to say hello to you on the forum!</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Because of that experience, I felt like I could reach greater heights. I was emboldened to achieve more than I previously thought I would be able to. I felt comfortable enough to spread my wings, to try out different things, and to find my voice. It is 100% because of the encouraging spirit of Clickin Moms that I am the photographer that I am today.</p>
<p>The sense of competition that I had experienced from other photography groups isn’t what Clickin Moms is about. The idea that knowledge is a secret not meant to be shared isn’t the way this community operates.</p>
<p>Instead, Clickin Moms fosters a sense of positivity that runs through everything from serious image critiques to just shooting the breeze with each other about parenting and makeup and life. The forum is always a safe place to land for everyone, from seasoned pros to brand new photographers.</p>

			<h2>A community of teachers</h2>
<p>If you want to learn from some of the absolute best photographers in the industry, then join Clickin Moms. I am constantly amazed by the sheer talent that is represented on the forum.</p>
<p>Seemingly every genre is represented! From food photographers to landscape artists to documentary family photographers, so many gifted and experienced women are willing to share their knowledge in the interest of paying it forward.</p>
<p>And everyone on the forum has something to teach the other members. Think about that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Every</i> person has something to teach the others. Not just the pros. Not just the mentors. Every member has something unique to teach the rest of the community.</p>
<p>This makes it so that all members feel empowered to share often. The number of tutorials, videos, and critiques is absolutely mind-boggling. The Clickin Moms forum is a veritable treasure trove of photographic knowledge!</p>
<p>When I first became a member, I scoured the <a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/23-learning-library-tutorials-and-articles/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=megan%20arndt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial section</a>. I think I watched every single video in the library (and there are a lot!), read every article about lighting, composition, and editing, and downloaded every freebie that was offered.</p>
<p>I could not believe that all of this information was available to every member! All I had to do was log in and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>And if I have questions like “How can I set up back-button focusing on my new camera?” or, “How can I look cute and still be comfortable when I’m on a photo shoot?” all I have to do is reach out to my community. I am instantly inundated with all the information and knowledge out there on the subject.</p>

			<h2>A community of friends</h2>
<p>I have made some of my very best friends on Clickin Moms. My husband often jokes about my virtual friendships, but it is amazing how easy it is to find women that you click with (pun intended) on the forum.</p>
<p>From all over the world and from every background, I have found my tribe. We keep up on each others’ lives and find connection through our shared love of photography.</p>
<p>And when Clickin Moms hosts events where I finally get to meet these amazing women in person? I get so excited to see their faces in person, hear their voices, and hug their necks!</p>
<p>Where else are you going to find someone who gets it when you squeal with glee about Lightroom’s newest features? Or a friend who is willing to get up with you at 3:30 in the morning to trek to some epic sunrise location?!</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to meet some of the most amazing women through Clickin Moms that I otherwise never would have known. We’ve shared life through photography and beyond. I feel so fortunate to have been able to be a part of this community and form lifelong bonds.</p>

			<h2>A community</h2>
<p>Do you see a theme here? The most important part of Clickin Moms to me is that it is a <i>community</i>. It is a group of people who come together for the same purpose: to share their love of photography. It is a warm, supportive, fun environment and I feel incredibly lucky that I found it all those years ago.</p>
<p>And the most amazing part is that it always continues to grow and evolve. New tutorials are being added every day. New members are joining all the time. And new opportunities are presenting themselves.</p>
<p>As technology changes and new photographic trends are set, Clickin Moms will always be a place to go to for the most up-to-date information about it all. But it never loses its sense of close-knit community. It remains a place where everybody knows your name and everyone is rooting for your success.</p>
<p>Clickin Moms is my photography home and I can’t wait for you to join me there. See you on the forum!</p>

			<p>Like many mothers, I fell in love with photography when my children were born.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My younger three are each a year apart. When I began to have babies, my husband and I decided it would be best if I would quit my corporate job to become a stay at home mom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And then one day, my husband brought me a cheap digital camera.<i> I became obsessed with taking pictures!</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Every chance I could find, I would take pictures. After a few short years (and some serious camera upgrades), I decided to make this obsession a business. I would have never imagined that my love of photographing my kids would lead me to owning a thriving business.</p>

			<h2>Embracing my roots</h2>
<p>I am mom with a camera. Two decades later and many with many achievements under my belt, I will never run away from this description. It made me who I am today.</p>
<p>With babies and little kids at home, I would spend every moment of my free time taking their pictures. I had no intentions of becoming a professional photographer. I simply wanted to capture their sweet little faces and their every last move.</p>
<p>But when I did decide to make the leap to owning my own business, I made it a point to build that business around my family. My boys and my role as their mother were a huge part of every decision I made.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I realized how my life with my children was reflected in my business. I began as a maternity, baby, and family photographer. As my children began to grow, so did my photographic interests. I no longer wanted to photograph babies. I wanted to photograph tweens and teens because it mimicked my home life. I shifted my business, and changed my photographic niche.</p>

			<h2>Professional success from personal experience</h2>
<p>I fully believe that by embracing who I am as a mom with a camera has allowed me to take photos that demand to be noticed. I have had the opportunity to speak on the main stages at all of the major photography conferences. I have travelled the world teaching other photographers. I have had two studios in Downtown Chicago. This kind of success wasn’t an accident. It grew from me being confident in my voice and confident in shooting what I know.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was really the poster child of growing my business with my children. I found that I was more creative if I maintained the same headspace as I had within my home life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would argue with my boys about wearing coats outside while they were headed to school. They would always blow me off and instead they would wear a hoodie when it was 20 degrees outside!</p>
<p>Then I would head to my photo session with a kid that is the same age as my own children. Like my boys, my teen client also didn’t want to wear a coat. I was dealing with the same things and it felt so authentic and relatable! Work didn’t feel like work because I <i>knew how to capture this stage</i>. And it was fantastic!</p>

			<h2>Learning through a new life stage</h2>
<p>So after 17 years in business, I find myself in a new stage of life. And it has kind of left me in a funk of sorts.</p>
<p>My son recently graduated from high school. I couldn’t understand why this exciting event would make me feel down. But then one day it dawned on me.</p>
<p>As the busy mom of four boys, I have never really stopped to think about myself. My personal pursuits and professional pursuits have always been a mirror of them! This boy who is now venturing off on his own was the same one I stayed up nursing at night in one arm while editing with the other. And now he is grown and it can leave a mom feeling a little lost.</p>
<p>But rather than stay in the funk, I looked inward. I started to see myself and this business I love a bit differently. And the lessons I learned have been invaluable.</p>

			<h2>How to be a mom with a camera and run a business you love</h2>
<p>You can create a business on the foundation of being a mom with a camera. In fact, your role as a mother can be a strength! These are the big lessons I have learned running my business alongside running my family.</p>
<h3>Build your business around your family</h3>
<p>I will never regret the opportunities I declined to be a present mother for my children.</p>
<p>If you can only work one day a week at a certain time of the day do that. Anyone that wants to hire you will do so. Do not let anyone guilt you into making you feel as if you’re “unprofessional.” You can never ever get back the time and years you have with your children.</p>
<p>When I began my career I could only work on Sunday and Monday. That was when my husband had days off. When I went to market my services, I would do so during nap time! I would strap one baby in the Baby Bjorn, and the other two were in the stroller! Even as my boys grew older, I vowed to never miss a basketball game.</p>
<p>Did I worry that opportunities wouldn’t come back when I turned them down to be with my kids? Of course I did! But declining those allowed me to hone my craft, be part of my kids’ childhoods, and build a stronger foundation that kept those opportunities coming back until I could say yes on my terms.</p>
<p>Your clients will always be there. Your speaking engagements and the sponsorships will always be there. It’s easy to worry that the opportunities won’t come back. But I promise you, they will. Take the time to take inventory of what you value most and then allow those to control how you run your business.</p>

			<h3>Build a relationship with your clients</h3>
<p>Just as you have a relationship with your family, build one with those you photograph. I am so lucky to have an extremely loyal client base. The kids I have photographed as babies are still some of the same kids I am photographing at 18 years old and beyond.</p>
<p>I made it a point to build true relationships with those I photograph. By doing so, it creates longevity that can stand the time throughout any changes in the industry.</p>
<h3>Take pictures just for you</h3>
<p>It’s easy to get caught-up in creating photos for your audience or for work alone. But I urge you to take pictures just for you. You will thank yourself later.</p>
<p>There are no rules to the kinds of pictures you take. They can be of people within your photographic niche, or perhaps just a pretty snowflake you saw. You can even master self-portraits if that makes your heart sing!</p>
<p><em><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/things-you-should-photograph-other-your-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazing things you should photograph (other than your kids)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In this new stage of life I have been feeling a bit lost with my work, and what I had to offer, in spite of my amazing loyal following.</p>
<p>I originally felt it had to do with going through some sort of creative block. Although creative blocks were a real thing, I now know where they stemmed from. My kids are turning into adults, and I feel I am losing my identity.</p>
<p>No one talks about life after kids when you’re a photographer! Nurturing your soul with work just for you is the best way to prevent the slump and stay connected to your camera (even as the kids grow).</p>
<h3>Be present in the pictures with your kids</h3>
<p>I know that it is more comfortable behind the camera. But as a mom with a camera, you are motivated to photograph your kids’ lives. And a huge part of their lives is YOU.</p>
<p>Get in the pictures with your kids. These do not have to be perfect! But I promise that as those kids grow, you will be so happy to see all of your smiling faces together. The memories of you with them are the reason that you do what you do.</p>

			<h3>Continue to be a student</h3>
<p>Take the time to learn something new within the photographic industry at least once or twice a year. It really allows you to mentally grow in ways that manifest itself within your soul.</p>
<p>Even if you’re in love with your work, and your photographic style, stretch yourself. There is always a new technique to learn, a new piece of gear to master, and someone who can inspire you.</p>
<h3>Print your pictures</h3>
<p>I can’t stress this enough. You take pictures so that you can go back and look at them. Chances are, if they are trapped on a hard drive, you aren’t going to do that as much.</p>
<p>I take a lot of pictures. Printing all of them for the wall was a daunting process! However, I would print them as 5&#215;7 prints and store them in albums or boxes. It is so fun to pull out those prints to look at them.</p>

			<h2>Continuing to grow</h2>
<p>Photography after your child becomes an adult doesn’t seem like it should be a big deal. But it is to <i>this</i> momma.</p>
<p>Sometimes the world focuses so much on moms of little kids that we forget that you’re still a mom when those babies are 18 years old and they are headed off to college. Although I have a hunch that I will be ok, I do wish I had figured out who I am photographically while my kids were still young.</p>
<p>The bright side of this is that I can begin a new journey! There is a saying that when you reach all your goals, you should make new goals. That is where this stage of life has me now and while it’s maybe a little scary and uncertain, it’s exciting!</p>
<p>Regardless of where life takes me, I will always be a photographer.</p>

			<p>I have a long history with imagery.</p>
<p>Visual imagery has always played a big role in my life. I grew up with a love and appreciation of photography. From the snapshots my father took to document our family memories to the cover art on my record collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My last memory of my mom before she passed away is of us going through our box of photographs. We laughed ourselves to tears as we were taken back in time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I got my own first pocket camera when I was about 12 years old. I was happy to click away and capture memories my perspective and to have a different way of seeing than my dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a teen coming of age in the 1980’s, music videos changed how we listened to music. To this day, I visualize music when I am listening to it, regardless of the genre.</p>

			<p>In high school, I really wanted to learn photography. The language and technical aspects of the craft were so foreign to me and yet I wanted to understand them.</p>
<p>I was going to enroll in a photography class. I wanted to learn all about exposure and developing film in the darkroom. However, my academic requirements wouldn’t allow me to add this elective to my schedule. I did spend time in the darkroom with a couple of my friends who were taking the class. I think I can still smell the developing chemicals.</p>
<p>Fast forward a number of years to when my husband surprised me with a Canon film SLR camera. I was so excited to step up from the point-and-shoot cameras that I grew up with. I believed that a bigger, better camera would elevate my photographs. Silly, me…</p>
<p>I made a few feeble attempts over the years to learn. I signed up for community center classes. The books written by the experts left me dazed and confused.</p>
<p>Without any real resources to learn, I just defaulted back to my point and shoot camera. I resigned myself to capturing snapshots of my two little boys and the world around us.</p>

			<h2>A renewed commitment to learning</h2>
<p>Eventually. I found myself owning a DSLR. But the learning curve there was still the same as my old film SLR. It wasn’t until 2013 that my photographic dreams were answered by the big wide world of the internet.</p>
<p>My goal was to take the kind of pictures that I envisioned in my mind’s eye. I typed “improve your photography.” That got me started.</p>
<p>Then the search for “how to learn manual mode” led me to a blog run by a Clickin Moms member. She sang the praises of Clickin Moms, so I thought I’d see what the fuss was all about.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her rave review, I took a leap of faith and signed up with a Lifetime membership. Once I got myself situated and figured out where to find things, my life quite literally changed.</p>

			<h2>The value of constructive critique</h2>
<p>Before finding Clickin Moms, I had come across other forums. They were mostly male dominated (sorry guys!) and they were just plain harsh.</p>
<p>The critiques were critical and rarely constructive. I left those experiences feeling beaten down, believing that my photos had no redeeming qualities.</p>
<p>This was one of the most helpful things about Clickin Moms to shape me as a photographer. The members, Click Pros, and Clickin Moms Mentors all left me kind but constructive feedback on my images. They told me both my strengths and weaknesses. This allowed me to correct the mistakes, feel proud of my progress, and stay motivated to keep improving.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/2-serious-critique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Receive constructive critique on YOUR images from industry professionals on the Clickin Moms forum. See how here!</i></b></a></p>
<p>Not only did reading the critiques about my own work help me to develop my skills, but so did reading the expert critiques of other photos and providing peer critique for my fellow forum members. Studying the work of other photographers, regardless of whether they are brand new to photography or masters in the art, is one of the most valuable learning tools there is.</p>
<p>It’s easy to look subjectively at a photograph and say that you like or you don’t like it. However, I believe it is way more valuable to ask the question “Why?” It’s important to be objective and to dissect the elements in an image and say, “This works/doesn’t work because of A, B, and C.” Offering actionable points on how the photograph can be improved upon has been key to helping me assess how to improve my own photos.</p>
<p>Learning to look at photographs objectively has been a game changer for me. That’s not to say that I don’t still have times when I dislike my work or wish I could improve. We all have times like these! But Clickin Moms has given me the tools to look at those so-called weaknesses and devise plans to move toward making stronger images.</p>

			<h2>Keeping me accountable</h2>
<p>As I continued to learn, I found myself wanting some accountability to stay motivated to shoot. This is when I found a Project 52 group on Clickin Moms.</p>
<p>I had heard plenty of times that daily shooting was the best way to get better. Other photographers recommended big endeavors like the 365 Project, but wasn’t sure that I could commit to daily shooting.</p>
<p>Having a weekly goal of interpreting a theme or technical prompt would be perfect. It would help me practice my skills and to develop my creativity without having to stress about a daily photo.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/37-contests-and-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Need accountability or motivation in your photography? The Clickin Moms community has contests, events, and group projects happening all the time! Check them out here. </i></b></a></p>
<p>Posting my work to the group and interacting with other members gave me confidence. Not only did the P52 help me grow as a photographer, it helped me establish a real, supportive community bonded by a shared interest.</p>
<p>I gained confidence and really started to feel like I was capable of sharing my work. As my photography improved and I began to think like a photographer, I began to step forward and share that with the Clickin Moms community. Setting goals to share my work on the forum keep me shooting and editing and always striving to be better.</p>

			<h2>Finding inspiration in unexpected sources</h2>
<p>When I joined Clickin Moms, I thought I might be limited by my life stage. I didn’t have cute little babies whose every move I needed to capture. Instead, I had teenage children. I personally wasn’t really interested in documenting our daily life in an artful manner.</p>
<p>I learned that even if I wasn’t shooting the same thing that the majority of my fellow Clickin Moms was shooting, there was still plenty to learn!</p>
<p>The fact is, understanding how to manipulate exposure, what depth of field means, and what elements make a composition impactful are somewhat universal. When we understand these things, we have to tools to apply them to different genres.</p>
<p><a href="https://theclickcommunity.com/forums/forum/164-photography-by-type/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Whatever genres you love, you can find specific resources for them as a Clickin Moms member!</em></strong></a></p>
<p>So despite wanting to photograph nature, landscapes, and the mundane details around me, I was reading tutorials about shooting backlit maternity photographs. I devoured critiques on using <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/how-to-use-back-button-focusing-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back button focus</a> for freezing the action of fast-moving kids. I studied how to manipulate the quality and quantity of light.</p>
<p>To this day, I don’t limit myself to taking-in only the genres I shoot. I continue to look outside my wheelhouse (one look at my Instagram feed will back me up on this!) and Clickin Moms is a constant source of inspiration and variety.</p>

			<h2>Finding MY voice</h2>
<p>Through applying all that I had learned on the forum and shooting like crazy, I began to see patterns emerging in my work. I used lines, light, and perspective like words to convey my story.</p>
<p>Finding my visual voice through the help of peers, teachers, and mentors made me feel like my life-long dream of being a photographer was coming true. It’s one thing to be able to make a well exposed frame and to get your subject in focus. However, it’s an entirely different experience to be able to make images that can elicit an emotional response.</p>
<p>Once I was able to move past the technical aspects of photography and shoot from my soul, I found my creative purpose.</p>

			<h2>Finding my tribe</h2>
<p>One of the most unexpected ways in which Clickin Moms helped to shape me as a photographer was to introduce me to the most incredible, kind, talented and encouraging people I have ever met. I have developed <i>real </i>friendships through this worldwide online community.</p>
<p>When we talk about the Clickin Moms community, it’s important to not underestimate the role community plays in our artistic and person development. Having people in your life that you can trust to be honest with you and to help you work through creative slumps is invaluable. I love my tribe!</p>
<p>It’s been the greatest pleasure being able to surround myself with creative people. I never used to consider myself a creative type. But learning and growing in such a nurturing environment has made me a better photographer and a better person in the process.</p>
<p>Being a Clickin Moms member has changed my life. My only goal when joining the forum was to learn how to use my camera to its fullest potential. I wanted to be able to make better photographs.</p>
<p>It’s been a lifetime of being captivated by beautiful photography. And after years of being in awe of what well-known photographers could do, I have gained the confidence to count myself among them.</p>
<p><b>I am a photographer.</b></p>
<p>I am still and will always be a student of photography. The learning process never ends and I’m so happy that I have the Clickin Moms community to keep teaching, inspiring me and pushing me to continue growing in this craft.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see where your Clickin Moms membership takes you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As I let the technical rules and negative self-talk slip away my cup was filled with the creative goodness I had been yearning for.  It didn’t happen over night, but after nearly a decade of pursuing photography I began to feel like an artist. I now had something that was truly just for me.</p>

			<h2>A friend’s suggestion</h2>
<p>The story began 12 years ago. I indulged in a weekend away with my most cherished college friends.</p>
<p>We were all young mothers. One friend was a practicing trial attorney, the other an up-and-coming visual artist. My job was stay-at-home-mom.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>We sipped cheap red wine while nibbling on good cheese and chocolate, exchanging stories of motherhood. While my friends shared tales of lives intertwined with work and family, my stories largely revolved around my children.</p>
<p>I was keenly aware that my life offered no separation between work and family. During the conversation one of my friends gently suggested, “Maybe you need to find something you can do that doesn’t focus on your kids. Something just for you.”</p>
<p>I was a bit taken aback initially.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know my friend had only good intentions. After all, we had dreamed lofty dreams upon graduation from our progressive college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And those dreams didn’t include wading in the monotony of homemaking.</p>
<p>Spending our days food shopping, endless rotations of laundry, chaperoning children to and from school, T-ball games, ballet class, and Brownies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In college we didn’t think about battles over homework, bedtime routines, or child anxiety. Why would we?! We had a large world full of big possibilities. We just had to choose which opportunities we would take.</p>
<p>And yet there I was. And maybe you are there, too.</p>

			<h2>The push and pull of motherhood</h2>
<p>It’s absolutely necessary to clarify that I love being a mother. I have found great joy in raising a family. But I haven’t loved everything that being a mother entails. If we are being honest with ourselves, none of us do.</p>
<p>There is tremendous pressure placed upon the modern mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many of us feel the need to be everything to everyone and to do it all with a smile.</p>
<p>Social media has turned the heat on even higher for the young mothers of today’s generation. We are, quite simply, exhausted. Whether we work outside the home or in, we are all on call 24/7. We are always under the heavy cloud of “mom guilt”. It is easy to lose ourselves in all of it.</p>

			<h2>My photography journey begins</h2>
<p>A few years after our girls’ weekend, I purchased my first DSLR camera.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I bought it because I wanted to take better photos of my children ages 14, 12 and 7. They were busily engaged in their favorite activities of dance and sports.</p>
<p>I was desperate to make images that reflected this time in their quickly moving lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the next few years I happily immersed myself in mastering the art of photography.</p>
<p>I loved being creative and having a way to document my family’s special moments with more than just a snapshot. The years passed, and the number of digital images on my computer skyrocketed into the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>I was able to capture countless memories. Baseball games, concerts, dance recitals, summer vacations, family get-togethers, and holiday celebrations. My hard drive wasn’t the only thing that grew…so did my children!</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before my images were filled with the eye-rolling faces of teenagers. I loved photography more than ever before. But my subjects, the reason I invested in this photography venture, had other plans.</p>

			<h2>Finding new subjects</h2>
<p>I needed a new challenge. I loved my documentary work, but I could sense that something was missing for me in creatively.</p>
<p>At 49 years old, established in a marriage of 24 years, and with my children moving into adulthood, I enrolled myself in a summer workshop. I had high hopes that it would push me out of my comfort zone and give me creative direction.</p>
<p>The instructor, hearing my frustration over not knowing what to photograph for the assignments, encouraged me to give self-portraiture a try.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Facing midlife, and an endless list of self-criticisms, I had more reasons than ever to stay out of the frame.</p>
<p>Technically I had no idea how to make a self-portrait! I’m a documentary photographer, and setting up a self-portrait was completely foreign to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, I relish a good challenge. And since even my dog was disappearing when my camera came out, I had nothing to lose.</p>

			<h2>The first attempts</h2>
<p>The results from my first self-portrait session were underwhelming. However, I declared the session a success because I rose to the challenge of putting myself in the frame.</p>
<p>I worked with a small, hand-held remote to trigger my shutter. The process of putting myself in the frame was slow and tedious.</p>
<p>After a month or two, I lost steam. The joy of a challenge was overwhelmed by the frustration.</p>

			<h2>Recognizing the need for me</h2>
<p>My self portrait journey would be reignited when I uploaded our holiday photos. The images were filled with twinkling lights, sparkly paper, and joyous grins and laughter. But something was something missing – me.</p>
<p>This certainly was not the first holiday season where I wasn’t represented in photos, but it hit me particularly hard this year. I was there but I wasn’t. My absence left an eerie void and made me immeasurably sad.</p>

			<h2>A new motivation to be in the frame</h2>
<p>Seeing the need for a solution, I resolved to dive back into self portraits. I made a goal to complete a personal project creating at least one self-portrait a week.</p>
<p>I wish I could say I created beautiful, artful images with this new drive. But I didn’t. I felt awkward, struggling to make sense of where my hands should fall and what my expression should hold.</p>
<p>I didn’t always like the images I created. However, I did love the process of creating my portraits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each portrait I made held a bit of my heart and soul within it.</p>
<p>Using an interval timer wired to my camera, instead of a hand-held remote, the technical challenges of creating a self-portrait diminished. Setting aside 30 minutes a week, I turned my camera around and put myself in the frame. Later I would sit at my computer and edit each image so it perfectly matched my vision.</p>
<p>As I let the technical rules and negative self-talk slip away my cup was filled with the creative goodness I had been yearning for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t happen over night, but after nearly a decade of pursuing photography I began to feel like an artist.</p>
<p>I now had something that was truly just for me.</p>

			<h2>Finding community</h2>
<p>I joined an online group devoted to women and self-portraiture. We supported each other through the challenges of putting ourselves in the frame. We shared our work and encouraged each other to be better. It made all the difference in keeping me on track.</p>
<p>In this safe space we did more than show each other our images. We shared our personal stories, and in doing so, our vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a place to show up was as crucial to my journey as the new technical and artistic skills I was incorporating into my work. Gradually, along with the self-portraits, I shared pieces of my life.</p>
<p>The more comfortable I felt putting my art and my words into the world, the bolder and more creative my work became. Through self-portraiture I began to connect with other artists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The connecting point with each woman was vulnerability.</p>
<p>Valuable friendships were formed and fostered in a way that wouldn’t have happened without the hard work of making self-portraits. We are all different in ages, stages of life, geographic locations, and cultural backgrounds. And yet we connected over a passion for photography, and love of art.</p>

			<h2>Thinking outside the box</h2>
<p>The creation of self-portraiture is challenging. But don’t panic! There are countless ways to put yourself in the frame.</p>
<p>A self-portrait can be so much more than just a headshot. In fact, self-portraits don’t need to include a face…or even a physical body!</p>
<p>They can be made up of light and shadow alone. You can blur your image using motion and slow shutter speeds. Or try introducing multiple exposures to create something unique. If you give yourself permission to break free from the rules, the possibilities for your self-portraits are endless.</p>

			<h2>How self portraits have changed me</h2>
<p>With each self-portrait I‘ve created during the past year, I understand more about myself and what I want my life to look like. My family will always be the most important part of my world. But I am better at loving them when I take care of myself, too. Giving myself space to create just for me makes me better.</p>
<p>My self portraits allow me to create from a special place within. They have connected me to a community of artists. And they have allowed me to be truly present in the photos and memories I create for my family.</p>
<p>There was a time I couldn’t envision my husband and I standing quietly together without the persistent chatter of little voices. What would we do with all the quiet? I know now.</p>
<p>The journey continues, it will meander and intertwine with new adventures, creations, and growth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through it all I will take my camera and turn it toward something beautiful: me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I encourage you to do the same.</p>

			<p>I have always been an introvert. I have never liked to be the center of attention. And for me, my it can be difficult to share my photography. Risk taking does not come naturally to me and opening myself up to critique or even praise is frightening.</p>
<p><i>Can you relate?</i></p>
<p>However, early in my photography journey I quickly learn that if I wanted to improve, I would have to overcome my fears. I would have to open up to get the photos I wanted. To receive the valuable feedback I needed, I would have to share my work.</p>
<p><i>I would have to be brave.</i></p>
<p>And if you are like me, the goal of improving as a photographer is enough to take that first step outside your comfort zone. Here are some ways that you can continue to overcome your fears and move toward your goals as a photographer.</p>

			<h2>Turn off your defense mechanism</h2>
<p>You know those voices in your head. They are the ones that say, “I’m not good enough. I shouldn’t share this. I look ridiculous. People will judge me. Who cares about my work?”</p>
<p>That’s your brain’s defense mechanism talking. Trust me, it isn’t some sixth sense intuition that is warning you of impending disaster. It’s merely your fear talking to you, making you second guess yourself.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>And you are not alone in these fears. <i>Every</i> person experiences self doubt from time to time. Even the most seasoned photographers still get nervous before a session or before submitting their work for judgement.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can turn those voices off! When those voices whisper to you, you ignore them. They aren’t what is going to make you a better photographer.</p>
<p>Is it scary? Heck yes! But if you listen to your fear talk to you, you will stay in the exact same place as you are now. We all have the voices of self doubt. But the photographers who improve and reach their goals are the ones who ignore the fear and push forward.</p>

			<h2>Take more risks</h2>
<p>You become physically stronger by lifting heavier things more often. You become stronger against your creative fears by pushing against them more often.</p>
<p>Turning off that inner voice is very much like physical exercise. Just like exercise, it’s painful when you begin a new routine. You want to give up. But if you keep going, your body adjusts to its new routine and you are able to stretch yourself further than you could in the beginning.</p>
<p>The same is true with brain training. In the beginning, even the smallest tasks may feel like monumental risks. Set small goals for yourself and take it one baby step at a time. Maybe that means posting to Instagram once a week for a couple of months. Or perhaps you can submit a picture share to the Clickin Moms forum once a month.</p>
<p>Eventually, these small risks can allow you to take bigger steps to grow in your photography. You might just find yourself putting together a professional portfolio or submitting to a magazine!</p>
<p>As your brain gets used to this sort of exercise, it gets easier and easier to turn off that fear and take risks. So after you conquer one fear, you can move onto the bigger dreams that you have for yourself.</p>

			<h2>Embrace rejection</h2>
<p>I know, I know. No one likes to hear “no.” Rejection is tough and especially when it comes to something that is as personal as your art, rejection can be downright terrifying.</p>
<p>In taking risks you will fail. You will get rejected. And yes, it’s incredibly disappointing when that happens. But honestly, the <i>fear</i> of rejection is often much worse than the actual rejection itself.</p>
<p>And know that you are in good company when you face rejection. Every single success story comes with more than a few tales of being told “no.” The people who find the “yeses” are the ones who don’t let the rejections defeat them.</p>
<p>So embrace the rejections as stepping stones to finding the opportunities that are perfect for you. Allow hearing “no” to motivate you to try harder, learn something new, and work for “yes” next time.</p>

			<h2>Make connections</h2>
<p>Sometimes being an introvert in a field like photography can feel incredibly isolating. You are a one-man show, creating art by yourself, and sometimes other photographers can feel like the enemy. The competition.</p>
<p>But there is <i>so</i> much to be gained by finding your community. There is value in being able to share and talk about your work with other like-minded creatives.</p>
<p>Really, who else will understand you when you lament about the lack of clouds in the sky during sunset? Who else can you ask for advice on whether to convert an image to black and white? And who else will support and encourage you when you start to give in to fear?</p>
<p>Having a sounding board when you have doubts and having a support system when fear creeps on can make all the difference in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>helping your overcome challenges.</p>
<p>A community should be a group that is not competing against one another. Rather, it should be artists but working together to build each other up. In a craft that is often lonely, community should make us each feel supported and less isolated. A community will make you more brave.</p>

<p>I want you to post to social media. I want you to follow your community and lift other photographers up by commenting on their work. But for goodness’ sake, don’t count your followers or likes or comments. That will lead you down a path of empty comparisons and self doubt.</p>
<p>The point of sharing on social media is to put your work out into the world. It is not to gain validation or praise. Rather, it is to allow your art to be seen. It is a practice that allows you to see that your work deserves to be seen. It is a means to overcome your fears.</p>
<p>I want you to post to social media, and then I want you to ignore it for the rest of the day. Don’t look to see how many likes you’ve gotten. Don’t check to respond to comments throughout the day. Instead, let it sit out in the world before you attend to these things and bask in the pride of having overcome your fears.</p>

			<p>As I’ve learned to recognize and conquer my fears in the photography world, this ability has spilled over into other areas of my life too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find myself taking risks that I never would have before.</p>
<p>And this risk-taking has made my life so much more fun! Whether that’s singing karaoke at the school fundraiser (my 20-year-old self would have totally cringed at being the center of attention like that!) or introducing myself to a group of people when I don’t know anyone in a crowd, I am a much braver person than I was ten years ago.</p>
<p>So look inward and ask yourself if you have been holding back because of fear. If the answer is yes, start to let it go today. Start to open yourself and your art up to the world. Conquer the fears and be the photographer you were meant to be.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve always appreciated the art of photography. As a mother of two young children, my appreciation turned to a mission to document this fleeting stage of life.</p>
<p>I daily captured their growth and development and gained in confidence with each picture. But like so many beginner photographers, I wanted more from my photographs.</p>
<p>Armed with basic experience, my D3200 camera, and a Nikon for Dummies book, I took a leap of faith and switched my dial from auto to manual. Then I joined Clickin Moms and that’s where my photography really took flight.</p>
<p>I started on the forums and was amazed by the talent I found there. And everyone was so friendly! After a few breakouts and my first Click Photo School class, I had upgraded my camera to a Nikon D750 with a Sigma ART 35mm lens on it (still my favorite combination to this day!).</p>

			<p>I dove right into offering family photo sessions in my local community. Inspired by the talent I saw at Clickin Moms, I worked hard to become a Click Pro myself. Today I am proud to be running a successful photography business and owe so much of that to the Clickin Moms community.</p>

<p>Starting out on your own photography journey can be very daunting. There is so much to learn! All of those buttons and menus and rules can be overwhelming. And don’t get me started on Photoshop and Lightroom!  You have all these big ideas for your photos but it can be so hard to get them out of your head and into your camera.</p>
<p>Ask any photographer out there and she tell you that she felt the same way. There were times when I was disheartened and wondered, “Am I ever going to get this?!”</p>
<p>But there were also some great ‘AHA!’ moments on my learning path. These are the moments that have been the highlights in my journey. Be sure to do these things and you will be well on your way to all of your photography goals.</p>

			<h2>Learn how to shoot in manual mode</h2>
<p>Understanding the exposure triangle is key if you want to make your vision come to life. Learning to shoot in manual is the best way to fully understand your camera and have full control over your exposures.</p>
<p>You can learn to shoot in manual mode through a book, workshop, YouTube tutorials, or any other way that works best for your learning style. Practice adjusting your ISO, aperture, and shutter speed to get the results you want.</p>
<p>I promise that it will feel like you are fumbling at first. This is normal! But the more you practice, the easier it will become.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: Turn on your histogram and highlight blinkies in camera. When you check the back of your camera, you can see visual representations of your exposure.</p>
<p>The histogram confused me at first, but it doesn’t need to scare you! All you need to know is that the shadows are illustrated at the left of the graph and the highlights are illustrated at the right. All of the points in between are the midtones. If the graph is too high in any one section, make adjustments with your camera settings.</p>
<p>The highlight “blinkies” are another great way to quickly check your exposure in camera. These will be activated when the highlights are overexposed, blinking to warn you that there is no detail in this part of the file. You can make changes to your camera settings if these blinkies are on in an important part of the frame.</p>

			<h2>Study light</h2>
<p>I love light, I see it everywhere. Once you start to see light, you can’t stop (and won’t want to!).</p>
<p>Whether it’s hazy back light or harsh shadows in midday sun, I have learned to love all types of light. That said, different light requires different kinds of shooting techniques. As photographers, it is up to us to study the light so we know how to photograph it best.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: If your camera is struggling to focus when backlighting, try using your lens hood! It can block some of that direct sunlight and will help your camera find areas of contrast to focus on more easily.</p>

			<h2>Consider composition</h2>
<p>Composition is simply where you place things within a photograph. Good composition happens when you place your subjects in such a way that it draws the viewer into the frame. The difference between a snapshot and a photograph is often intentional composition.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if you want your subject to fill the frame or if you want to show a lot of the environment around your subject. How do those different set-ups change the way you see your subject? Are you drawn to one over the other? Why?</p>
<p>PRO TIP: Use the rule of thirds. This simply refers to placing your focal point on one of the lines that divides the photo into thirds. Our eyes are naturally drawn to these intersections in a picture. Putting your subject here (either when shooting or when cropping later) will make the frame feel balanced and intentional.</p>

			<h2>Understand white balance</h2>
<p>I cringe when I look back at my early work and can see clearly that my white balance was off. But most people have no idea what white balance even is!</p>
<p>White balance refers to making the colors in your photographs look natural. Depending on the light source and reflective surfaces in a given scene, the camera can read the colors inaccurately. It is up to the photographer to see and correct this.</p>
<p>You can adjust your white balance in camera by using preset white balance settings or dialing in white balance with custom Kelvin settings. Or you can adjust your white balance in post processing. Either way, you will need to train yourself to see what kind of color is correct so you know when it requires adjustments.</p>
<p>To train my eye I use an Expo Disc and I highly recommend it! I can now tell by quickly checking the back of my camera if my white balance is off.</p>
<p>TIP &#8211; Correct white balance is how the eye sees color. You will want golden hour images to be warmer and blue hour images to be cooler.</p>

			<h2>Learn how to edit your photos</h2>
<p>You will always want to strive to get the best images you can straight out of camera. But I believe that editing your photos is a chance to put your own unique artistic stamp on your work.</p>
<p>I always start my editing by making sure I have my exposure and white balance just right. If these are not on point, none of the other adjustments I make will look the way I want them to.</p>
<p>I then find the preset I think best suits my image and adjust from there. This allows me to edit quickly but still tweak things from the preset so that the edit is uniquely mine.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: Play with the sliders in Lightroom to understand what they do. Then you will know just which slider to move when you need to make an adjustment to a preset!</p>

			<h2>Find your community</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried to talk to a non-photography friend about lenses or cameras or editing programs? Did you see her start to doze off while you were talking? This is why it is so important to find community!</p>
<p>With the Clickin Moms community, I have found a place where I can talk all day about photography and everyone GETS IT! Even better, I am always surrounded by inspiration and am always learning from amazing artists.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: When on the Clickin Moms forums, head over to the tutorial section where you will find exclusive lessons written by professionals. They are divided into easy-to-navigate categories so you can find just what you need.</p>

			<h2>Trust your vision</h2>
<p>The reason I have progressed so quickly from beginner to pro is that I became obsessed with the art of photography. I practiced every day and read and watched everything I could on the subject. I studied other photographers’ work so I could find my own artistic style and personality.</p>
<p>What began as documenting my family became a way for me to be creative in the midst of being a mum. I allowed myself to see in a new way. I trusted that my way of seeing the world was worth perfecting.</p>
<p>Photography came to me. I grabbed it with both hands and it has unfolded easily and beautifully for me. That&#8217;s not to say I haven&#8217;t worked hard. I put in plenty of hours of work! But rather than struggling against where I am at, I have embraced the journey.</p>
<p>And I am still learning and growing everyday! Clickin Moms gives me a place to continue my journey and the resources and relationships there have been key to me becoming the photographer I am todya.</p>
<p>Find your own way in photography. It is a wonderful journey and no matter what your path looks like, it is one worth following.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Love is the light in which we see each thing in its truest origin, nature and destiny. If we could look at the world in a loving way, then the world would rise up before us full of invitation, possibility and depth.</i>” &#8211; John O’Donohue</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I first ventured into photography I assumed it was exclusively for me. The first real camera I purchased was just for me. I took my first workshop for my own personal growth. I feasted on the inspiration of others for my own enjoyment. What began as a hobby took root and blossomed into a full-fledged personal passion.</p>

			<h2>Art is not just for us</h2>
<p>Does art ever really belong to us?</p>
<p>Inspiration whispers, “Here I am. Create with me.” We press the shutter, the work is incarnated and our heart soars at the miracle of it. While the work bears our imprint, it is not really not ours.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>
<p>In the moment of creation it belongs to the universe. It belongs to our families, to our clients, and to the pool of inspiration we all drink from.</p>
<p>It’s much like motherhood, really. Perhaps the heartache of every mother is an acknowledgement of this truth &#8211; our children are not ours alone. Successful parenting is defined by its ability to love and let go. It’s a job we work ourselves out of. It sounds a bit tragic but we are working toward our own absolution.</p>
<p>Art, like a child, is created for its own sake, not ours.</p>

			<h2>Art is created to give away</h2>
<p>Not only is art created for its own sake, it’s created to give away. Every artist works to create for others. It can be for the enjoyment of others, the validation from others, or any number of potential motivations.</p>
<p>Of course there are examples like Vivian Maire. She was an American street photographer who privately documented Chicago and NYC during the second half of the twentieth century. And she never shared her images during her lifetime.</p>
<p>Her massive body of work was discovered in a thrift shop. While she never sought to share or publish a single image, she also never destroyed them. Today over 10,000 prints and negatives have been catalogued and archived. The universe wanted her art to be shared.</p>
<p>You see, we don’t create in a vacuum. The images we create are inspired by the beauty all around us. We receive, interpret and return what we observe. When we photograph it’s a form of thanks. And gratitude cannot exist without a recipient.</p>

			<h2>Passion work</h2>
<p>My greatest growth as a photographer has been during times of least profit.</p>
<p>That might make you go, “HUH?!” But truly, I have found that when we are only creating for a business or for personal gain, our creativity suffers.</p>
<p>I will never tell you that running a profitable business with your photography is a bad idea. In fact, it’s often a very good idea! However, I do believe that when we abandon the idea of “giving back” with our photography, we close ourselves off to real inspiration.</p>
<p>As creatives we are made to have our hearts easily stirred. When we are only focused on transactions or self-centered pursuits, we do not allow ourselves to feel. It’s the emotion of any given scene that helps us to create memorable imagery and we need to be sure to be open to that as we use our cameras.</p>
<p>So how do we give back? Where do we start to find a way to allow us to stay inspired? I would tell you to start by asking these four questions:</p>
<p><i>1. What aspect of my story makes needs to be shared?</i></p>
<p><i>2. Who in my community needs encouragement?</i></p>
<p><i>3. What issues touch my heart?</i></p>
<p><i>4. What photographer could use encouragement on her journey?</i></p>

			<h2>Share your story</h2>
<p>My dear friend’s son was diagnosed with cancer three years ago. I watched as their family navigated the challenges and hardships of treatment. He is in remission today, but the impact of his cancer is still present in his day-to-day life.</p>
<p>His story has impacted my own in a most profound way. It has deeply affected how I see my world, my family, my clients, and every person I encounter. There are no “givens” in life. Each day is truly is a gift.</p>
<p>Inspired by my brave friend and her brave son, I’m a volunteer with the <a href="http://goldhopeproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold Hope Project</a>. Gold Hope is a non-profit that provides free portrait sessions for pediatric cancer patients. I also volunteer my photography once a month at Boston Children’s Hospital to photograph chronic and terminally ill kids and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/35-photographs-inspired-gold-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 Photographs inspired by Gold Hope</a></strong></p>
<p>Who has impacted your story? What events have shifted your perspective? Chances are, your creativity would be a gift to someone in need. Consider ways you can use your photography to celebrate life and love, to offer hope, and to raise awareness.</p>

			<h2>Give back to your local community</h2>
<p>My business mission statement is <i>to bring experiences of transcendent relationship through photography to those in my community who need them most.</i> In addition to running a for-profit business, I work to give back to my community in an intentional way.</p>
<p>These are simple ways that I give back that you can do in your own communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>offer free sessions to families in crisis</li>
<li>offer free sessions to church ministers and your children’s teachers</li>
<li>donate sessions each year to local school and charity auctions</li>
</ul>
<p>I have guidelines on how many free sessions I donate a year. We aren’t super she-roes and will exhaust ourselves if we try to take on all of the need without taking care of ourselves. You must take the time to figure out how to create balance with your business, your family, and your nonprofit work.</p>

			<h2>Identify what unique touches your heart</h2>
<p>Issues that adversely affect children break my heart more than anything. It is what led me to work for Gold Hope and why I took my camera to Thailand to document <a href="https://www.joytotheworldthailand.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breanna’s House of Joy</a> for 10 days. When I heard about the work that was being done there to rescue and empower girls, I knew I was meant to be there.</p>
<p>What issues stir your heart? What motivates you to action? Your photography is your voice. Even better, your photography can be a tool to help bring awareness, funding, and/or resolution to the issues that matter to you.</p>
<p>Reach out to the nonprofits and see if there is anything you can do to support their cause. Perhaps it is documenting the nonprofit in action. Maybe it is auctioning one of your prints to help fund the nonprofit. Or perhaps there is another way that you and your camera can support the cause. In the end, creating for causes that move you will make you a better, more fulfilled photographer.</p>

			<h2>Help other photographers on their own journeys</h2>
<p>Every living thing needs nurturing to grow. I am the photographer I am today because of other photographers who poured into me.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to keep all of our knowledge and expertise to ourselves. We don’t want to fuel the competition, do we?! However, I promise that when you encourage others and share with them, you will also be encouraging your own growth.</p>
<p>How can you encourage and support photographers on their journey? What unique insights/gifts can you use to nourish the field of photography?</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of the Clickin Moms community is that it is focused on encouraging others and working together to become the best photographers we can be. It’s where I met my own encourager, Clickin Moms mentor Jen Bilodeau. Her generosity has encouraged me to be just as generous with others.</p>

			<h2>Use your camera to reveal beauty</h2>
<p>If photos aren’t really ours to begin with, I don’t see a lot of wiggle room when it comes to giving back. Indeed, I believe the real job of the photographer is to see through all the mundane, ugly, and hard. We are meant to see what matters most and to put it right for the world to see.</p>
<p><i>I believe that our beautiful calling is to affirm meaning</i>.</p>
<p>We have been gifted a unique was of seeing the world. Therefore, we have an obligation to share that unique perspective with a world that might feel weary otherwise.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to use your camera for pursuits outside of your own personal gain. Seek out ways to help others with your creativity. I promise you will discover that you are just as encouraged and inspired as a result.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">“<i>The camera is an instrument that teaches people to see without a camera</i>” &#8211; Dorothea Lange</p>
<p>Six years ago I picked up-a camera. Little did I know that photography would shape who I am and how I think.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be surprised as the creative process is deeply personal. Life will always imitate art and art will always mirror life.</p>
<p>In my work, I use every artistic choice as a means of communicating with my audience. In doing so, I have discovered that the rules and lessons of photography are not only applicable to my pictures, but also to my life.</p>
<p>The rules of composition are my artistic first principles. They tell me where to put my subject in the frame. They guide me to create balance and harmony in my photography. And the rules of composition allow me to construct the most pleasing experience for my audience.</p>
<p>So what LIFE principles can we draw from the rules of composition that might also become reflexive? Gleaned from my own experience, struggles and failings these are the rules that work for both photography and life.</p>

			<h2>The Rule of Thirds: the intersection of purpose and passion</h2>
<p>Placing a subject at the intersection of vertical and horizontal thirds lines creates tension, energy, and interest in a composition. While centering the subject might be instinctive, using the rule of thirds allows for a more dynamic photograph.</p>
<div class="soliloquy-feed-output"><img class="soliloquy-feed-image" src="https://www.theclickcommunity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21July-CC_blog_CTAs.jpg" title="Click Community" alt="21July-CC_blog_CTAs" /></div>

			<p>Along what life axes does your photography run? What intersection creates the most “tension, energy and interest” for you?</p>
<p>For me it’s where my purpose and my passion intersect.</p>
<p>I never set out to start a photography business. I was simply taking pictures with such passion I overlooked that I was regularly booked and starting to make an income.</p>
<p>But eventually, my passion began to wane. My style was stronger than ever, but business no longer excited me. It didn’t make sense!</p>
<p>I realized that in the unfolding of my passion I’d never stopped to consider my purpose. If you find yourself in this position, take the time to really define why you pick up your camera and what you want to do with it. Write down a mission statement and keep it in your mind every time you prepare to take a photograph.</p>
<p>This isn’t just for those of you in business. If you’re a hobbyist who loves to photograph her kids you should still find your why!</p>
<p>If you have all the passion and prowess but are feeling unfulfilled by photography, it is likely that you are yearning for a clearly defined purpose. I’ve been there! And I know that passion will burn out long before purpose.</p>
<p>The strength of your contribution to photography lies at the intersection of your passion and your purpose. If passion is the flame, purpose is its fuel. Find your why and it will feed your passion.</p>

			<h2>Balancing Elements: We are more than photographers</h2>
<p>Balance is a compositional technique that places objects within a frame so they are of similar visual weight. When different parts of a photo command your attention equally, balance is achieved.</p>
<p>This is easier to accomplish in camera than in life! Where is your life most weighted? What has happened to the other interesting parts of you that existed before photography?</p>
<p>I’m an “all in” person who loves the satisfaction of knocking down goals. When photography seized my heart it seized my full attention too.</p>
<p>It’s easy to want to ignore everything else around us when we have a passion like photography. However, it is so important to create balance in the camera and beyond.</p>
<p>Strive to live your WHOLE life. Put the camera down and read a book. Have coffee with an old friend. Take a flower-arranging class. Learn how to wallpaper a room. Nurture relationships and give your passion room to breathe.</p>
<p>The best part? Creating balance in life, just like creating balance with your composition, will make your photography better.</p>

			<h2>Isolating the Subject: Putting importance where it’s due</h2>
<p>When we create an image, we use our in-camera settings as well as the background/foreground to make the subject matter obvious to the viewer. The strength of an image lies in its clearly defined focal point.</p>
<p>We know how to prioritize our subject…do we know how to prioritize our life?</p>
<p>I believe the pursuit of true photographic excellence lies first in humbly acknowledging that we capture only a dim reflection of what REALLY matters. Sometimes, we must put the camera down to prioritize the people and things that matter most.</p>
<p>I faced the crisis of an ovarian tumor eight years ago. I recently I sat in the ER waiting to learn if another tumor had developed in my remaining ovary.</p>
<p>In the chairs across from me a man told his friend that his cancer has returned and was terminal. They cried together and my heart split wide open. I cried into my book for a man who would begin his goodbyes.</p>
<p>I could see myself in him and begged for more time to watch my girls grow while I grew old with my husband. For the five hours it took to run all my tests, not one thought was about my backlog of edits, the session inquiry in my inbox or even this blog deadline. Life has a way of distilling quickly when it might be snatched away.</p>
<p>Some of us know our camera manual better than our personal manual. As often as we do a sensor cleaning (which for me is never often enough!), we need to clean our internal sensor and do a little self-assessment.</p>

			<h2>Framing: Minimizing distraction and negativity</h2>
<p>As we compose an image, we strive to be conscious of which elements to include in the frame and which to exclude. We eliminate distractions that don’t add to the visual narrative.</p>
<p>And yet we live in an external world of distractions! What choices can we make to minimize them?</p>
<p>I still remember the day I joined Instagram. Always behind trends, I was late to the game and curious to understand the hype. Now I know why so many of us are addicted! In an ocean of puffy hearts, it’s so easy to be swept away in likes and comments.</p>
<p>Social media shines where it allows us to celebrate each other. My heart soars when I see art celebrated and community thrive. However, we must be careful to protect ourselves from comparison. We cannot allow ourselves to find value in these fleeting interactions.</p>
<p>We have to choose every day what to let in to our “frame” and what to exclude. There’s only space for so much. If it doesn’t enrich and edify your life, cut it out. Life, like photography, is the art of exclusion.</p>

			<h2>Perspective: Allow your personality and viewpoint to shine</h2>
<p>Our viewpoint has an enormous impact on the composition of our photo, greatly affecting its message. Each time we lift the camera, we’re deciding whether to shoot from eye level, from above, at ground level, from the side, from the back, from far away, close up, and so on. The viewpoints are infinite. So what makes yours unique? YOU!</p>
<p>In life, our viewpoint is what separates us from everyone else. It makes us unique. It makes us wonderful. And if we try to be anyone else, we will struggle to find fulfillment.</p>
<p>So embrace your truth. Define what moves you. Seek what inspires you. Allow those things to emerge in both your photographs and in your life choices.</p>
<p>My family was extremely close growing up. Relocating several times caused us to lean hard into each other.</p>
<p>As a result, I adore photographing families and mirroring their love for each other.</p>
<p>My husband and I underwent a major home renovation when my oldest daughter was 3 to 10 months old. I grieve that I didn’t have to margins to truly enjoy her infancy&#8230;only survive it.</p>
<p>Today newborn sessions are my chance to slow down and savor all the little things for my clients.</p>
<p>My life story has shaped who I am as a photographer. Allow your personality and life experiences to infuse your work. Even if it means that you aren’t shooting what is on-trend, I urge you to seek what truly inspires you. For the love of yourself,<i> </i>don’t try to be somebody you aren’t!</p>

			<h2>Leading Lines: Staying the course</h2>
<p>Leading lines draw the viewer’s attention to the image’s main subject. A leading line paves an easy path for the eye to follow through different elements of a photo.</p>
<p>Where do your life lines lead you? What goal is on your horizon?</p>
<p>I imagine photography to be like a long winding road of leading lines with no final destination. When we first pick up our cameras, we may not really looking for a destination. We are just having fun and are excited by creating “blurry backgrounds” and capturing memories. We may be totally off-roading on that photographic path but we’re having a ton of fun!</p>
<p>It’s when the hobby of photography becomes a <i>passion</i> that we’re motivated to speed up. All the rules and techniques we’ve learned become the curbs to keep us on course. We start to notice others on parallel journeys. We see their speed and yearn to match it.</p>
<p>When the passion becomes an <i>obsession</i>, driver beware! We may focus on the road, forgetting to take in the view.</p>
<p>Perhaps we swerve trying to create beauty while forgetting how to receive it. We sense our own acceleration and watch the road that much closer. We might even slam on the brakes afraid of our own speed and feel creatively blocked at the times we least expect it.</p>
<p>Your journey has its own bends, peaks, and valleys. The scenery is uniquely yours. I encourage you to keep moving on your personal photo journey!</p>
<p>But be sure to keep looking up so as not to miss your life whizzing by. Shoot for purpose not approval. Fail and break a few rules in pursuit of your own voice. Above all, remember that there’s no final destination. There’s only the moment unfolding in front of your camera, begging to be immortalized.</p>
<p>Start thinking about the ways your photography affects how you think and behave. I know I need all kinds of reminders and love returning to first principles. I would love to hear what life lessons you have learned from photography so be sure to share them in the comments below!</p>
