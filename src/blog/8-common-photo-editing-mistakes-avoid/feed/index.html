					<description><![CDATA[Great article and mistakes that I see very often. 

I could add though that with noise or grain it can add to the feel of an image but not all images. I will often keep a small amount in black and white edits. This does though depend on the image and the effect I am trying to create.

Also presets can work if you have a style that you want to keep consistent throughout your images. You do have to remember though that after a preset is applied you do still need to adjust the image to correct it.
