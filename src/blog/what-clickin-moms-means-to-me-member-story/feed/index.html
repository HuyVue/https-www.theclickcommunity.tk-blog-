					<description><![CDATA[I am nodding the whole time reading this.  CM is such a welcoming and inspiring community.  It was exactly what I was looking for and is now a part of my daily life and photography journey.  I find so many other forums to be overly focused on gear and not inspiration, art, or capturing emotion, and some threads are downright cruel! That is not the case with clickinmoms and I&#039;m eternally grateful for this amazing group of photographers and artists. And it&#039;s not just moms, btw! There are plenty of members who aren&#039;t parents and even men too.  It&#039;s a very open group.]]></description>
