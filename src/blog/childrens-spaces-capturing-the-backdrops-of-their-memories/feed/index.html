					<description><![CDATA[Fabulous article Kellie! I&#039;ve found myself (as I&#039;m looking through images from our old house) kicking myself for not capturing the &quot;real&quot; stuff! I love your tips and will use them this time around so I&#039;m not left wondering what things really looked like!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was such a great article Kellie; thank you!! I don&#039;t have any kids but I just got back from a trip to London &#038; Paris with my husband and was looking through all of my pictures... I noticed that I shoot incredibly tight and I like clean shots without a lot of distractions. I was purposely zooming in or shooting up so people wouldn&#039;t be in my shot if I was taking pictures of monuments etc. I was so sad by the end when I realized I didn&#039;t really capture that many shots of the busy streets or things that I didn&#039;t think would make &#039;pretty photos&#039; but that context and environment is now what I&#039;m wishing I had the most. A great lesson to learn from!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are great reminders!  I tend to forget this sometimes!!  I think it&#039;s one of the things that I also enjoy about looking at my grandmother&#039;s photos they snapped in their home, because you see the house in the background and the things I could see that still had even all this years later!]]></description>
