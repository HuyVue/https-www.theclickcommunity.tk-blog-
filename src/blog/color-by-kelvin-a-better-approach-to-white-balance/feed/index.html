					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I understand what you did when addressing Myth #1. Can you help me? My understanding of RAW is that you never &quot;see&quot; RAW. It isn&#039;t applying any viewing format&#039;s code yet. When you look at your RAW photos on the camera or in LightRoom, you&#039;re looking a jpeg rendering of the photo. If you&#039;ve set the camera&#039;s white balance, the &quot;RAW&quot; photo you look at is a rendering that honors those inputs. Isn&#039;t that correct? So, then when you did the B&#038;W conversions, weren&#039;t you converting a RAW photo whose rendering was affecting by your adjustments? 

I am a Nikon user, who always selects both RAW and Fine jpeg. I set my camera up to avoid having to do much post-processing. But if I want/need to, I can go back to the larger resolution RAW file to make different adjustments, either based on the in-camera jpeg settings or scrapping them. 

I guess in short, I&#039;m still unconvinced it&#039;s a myth.My understanding is still that RAW is only affected by ISO, aperture and shutter settings. You are saying the jpeg or TIFF presets still affect RAW?

Thanks for any further explanation you have to correct my misunderstanding.

Yes, absolutely! Your color temp changes as you move in and out of lighting scenarios (such as sunlight to shade) as well as when the light itself changes (such as cloud cover moving in or sunset approaching). :)]]></description>
