					<description><![CDATA[Photograph #2 With Daddy is so perfect. I photograph newborns in their hospital room so photo #2 caught my eye. Can you direct me to a tutorial of how to photograph in front of a window. Mine always seem to have the subject too dark and the window too bright. I cannot seem to get the right exposure. Thank you.]]></description>
