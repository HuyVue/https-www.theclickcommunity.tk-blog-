Hi Nicki! The best lens really depends on your budget and what you want to shoot... the Canon 100mm is great from what I&#039;ve heard. I love the lensbaby velvet personally. Tamron and Sigma also make great lenses! I teach the macro class at Click Photo School if you&#039;re interested in learning more! I also have a few other tutorials such as this one: https://www.clickinmoms.com/blog/5-macro-photography-mistakes-youre-making/]]></description>
