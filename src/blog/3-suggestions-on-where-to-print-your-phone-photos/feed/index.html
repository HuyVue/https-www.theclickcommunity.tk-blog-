					<description><![CDATA[Love this article! I think I might need to experiment with some of these in 2018. I currently use Fox Prints for my art and Social Print Studio for other items. I have wondered about Persnickety and of course AU is always amazing!
Thanks for highlighting my stands! Iâ€™m happy to announce they will return to the shop February 1st! ...and I have a lot of fun variation in store for them in the year ahead!]]></description>

They have a bunch of different products, but mine is the great collages you can have printed. Also a local San Francisco company, which I think is neat.]]></description>
