					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article. I have four teens. I have searched long and hard for advice and photographic inspiration particular to the teenage years. I&#039;d love to find more articles, blogs, and photos that go beyond posed images and standard senior shots. Perhaps Clicking Moms could begin to fill the gap for all the mothers of children beyond the elementary years? I think you&#039;d find that many of us would appreciate it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My son hates having his photo taken now. I have tried when we are out and about but usually end up with a photo with hands in the way. 

Why does Peppa Pig stop working when they get to 13?]]></description>

Those teenage opinions and eye rolls can be SO frustrating but we agree that it&#039;s a special time worth capturing &lt;3. Glad you enjoyed the article, Brandy!]]></description>

The teen years have their own special kind of magic and while it isn&#039;t the same as photographing the younger years, we think it&#039;s pretty special ;). Glad you liked the article!]]></description>
