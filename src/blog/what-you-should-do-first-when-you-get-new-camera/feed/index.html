					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s exciting when you get a new camera, I&#039;m waiting for a Canon R5 to arrive today actually.  However, what is more exciting is when you get to a point in your photography where you know even if you use an old camera, you can still take great photos.  I recently bought a &#039;new&#039; camera, but it is a 5 year old model (5Dsr).  It was really cheap, but in my hands I can still get great photos from it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that&#039;s how us photo-mommas start out... wondering what to do with &quot;the nice camera&quot; you get as a gift.  Great tips!  Most helpful one for me is to read the manual.  Even as a professional photographer for many years, I still do this when I get a new camera.  Happy shooting!]]></description>
