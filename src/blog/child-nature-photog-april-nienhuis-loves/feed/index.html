Not weird at all, Amanda! The ones you can&#039;t bear the thought of getting rid of entirely I would keep though. You just never know when someone won&#039;t return a book or lose it or something.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you liked this, Christopher! Chickens really are the best. I didn&#039;t realize how much I&#039;d love them until we got our first batch earlier this year. Everyone who comes over really enjoys them, too :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved reading this Thank You.

My parents had chickens and the kids loved them. They were free range and went everywhere. I don&#039;t mean around the garden. We would often have people knocking at the door to say they were in their garden. One time we even had someone say that they were in the house. After saying sorry they told me they didn&#039;t mind as the kidscwere having so much fun. Wish I had my camera that day as unsent to collect those chickens.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahhhh!  I LOVED reading this, April! I feel like I know you so much better now.  I need one of those ZZ Plants - how cool is that?  And I actually own hundreds of cookbooks HUNDREDS!  I need must have to give them away...I really only do recipes from google searches anymore.  But my local library has a great cookbook section and I&#039;ve checked out many of them just because I love them so much.  Two of my recent library check-outs were Giada&#039;s healthier cookbook (can&#039;t remember the name exactly, but GIADA, right?  She&#039;s amazing) and The Simple Green Smoothie book.  I just enjoyed reading them.  Would it be weird if I dropped off all of my cookbooks at the library and then just checked them out occasionally?  I wonder if you can do that... I can&#039;t bear the thought of getting rid of them entirely, I have some beautiful ones!  Anyway, loved reading this! I&#039;m super jealous of your farm animals!]]></description>
