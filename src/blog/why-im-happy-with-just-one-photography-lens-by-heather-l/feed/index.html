					<description><![CDATA[I have too many lenses and I could certainly learn more about the art!  I have the same lens and I am trying to love it now that I have a full frame.  I am inspired to put that lens on my camera for a few weeks and get to know it better.  Thank you for this post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in the same predicament in terms of lenses, so it was very exciting/inspiring/encouraging to read an article like this from such an amazing photographer. I shall be sticking with my Nikkor 35mm 1.8 and seek to improve my ability to take good pictures instead :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I came across this article after concluding that despite buying and using many lenses I&#039;d be happy with just my Rokkor 50mm 1.7 (on a 35mm Minolta XD5) and was curious if anyone else felt the same way about their 50mm.

Your images have a very classic look, I especially like the feet.

So much is possible with a fast or even moderately fast normal lens, it is a great shame that when most photographers start out they don&#039;t have a lens that allows them to use this field of view and effectively limit the depth of field.]]></description>
