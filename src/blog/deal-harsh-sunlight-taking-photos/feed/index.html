					<description><![CDATA[Do you have a tutorial on how you edit your photos or what settings are you using in harsh light? I was looking for that and didn&#039;t seem to find it. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are great! One question - If you&#039;re exposing for the highlights in these, are your RAW images pretty dark? Then you&#039;re bringing up the shadows a bunch in PP? Or are you also burning in the skies more? Your skies really look cool. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this. I&#039;ve been shooting mostly high-contrast B&#038;W images in bright sunlight, but this opens up so many more possibilities. I love the darker and moodier look of these images, and I can&#039;t wait to try this out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was a great read. I&#039;ve been thinking about how so often us photographers are slaves to the light. We have it drilled into us that there is a good light at certain times of day (and rightly so, golden hour, blue hour light is magical to work with). But the reality is, there is a hell of a lot more hours in the day outside of those magic hours, we need to find a way to work with it.]]></description>
