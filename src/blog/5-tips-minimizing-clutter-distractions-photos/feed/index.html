Brenda, I 100% feel you on this! Juggling motherhood and life in general is overwhelming and while I have always wanted to capture every moment with my camera, sometimes I found the mess of it all too daunting. But I promise you never regret taking the picture...even when there&#039;s peanut butter on the counter and laundry piled in the corner and shoes strewn around the living room (these are all things I can see from where I am sitting right now!). So glad that this article resonated with you! &lt;3]]></description>
