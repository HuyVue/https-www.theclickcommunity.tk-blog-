					<description><![CDATA[I shoot in RAW and edit in Lightroom but recently as my computer had got so full so quickly I have had to move all my images onto an external drive. There are realised that I am saving DNG and jpeg files of every image. Which one should I keep and which one DNG or JPEG keeps my edits, thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! I was personally first introduced with shooting in RAW when I was still learning about photography and I had no idea about the big difference and how much shooting and editing in RAW can be helpful and useful to give you real quality images. I actually use this: http://www.aftershotpro.com/en/pages/raw-file/  but no matter what software anybody is using, shooting in RAW gives more options when it comes to finalising the image you’ll use and gives you the chance to correct things that the settings on the camera might have got wrong,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi megan, i just started using RAW.  and i&#039;m wondering....after i export from lightroom, for some reason, the files are still only 700ish K.  Is this right?  Seems kinda small, especially if i need to enlarge something.  Do you have any thoughts on this?]]></description>

Danielle, most people use Lightroom or Photoshop ACR. There&#039;s tons of information about RAW processing on the CM forums! You can sign up with code VIP2013 for a free trial if you want to check it out! www.clickinmoms.com/signup]]></description>

Hey Sharon! Odds are that you aren&#039;t seeing as much noise with the JPEG because the camera is applying automatic noise reduction to that JPEG. You can apply noise reduction to your RAW images in Lightroom or ACR.]]></description>
