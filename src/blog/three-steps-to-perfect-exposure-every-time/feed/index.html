					<description><![CDATA[This was a wonderful tutorial. I haven&#039;t bought my grey card yet, but I have been thinking about it for over a year and always put it in the back burner. Now with a better knowledge of how exactly to use it, it is at the top of my shopping cart! Thanks so much for the tips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lacey this is such a great article. This is really hard for me for some reason. Metering is really new to me...embarrassing to say. I have a canon rebel, can I meter with this camera? I still haven&#039;t upgraded to a full frame camera. 
Thank you for this.
